1	Jonathan Libby	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Libby	1	Jonathan Libby is a contestant from Survivor: Palau. Jonathan is best known for being one of the first people to be eliminated from the game via Schoolyard Pick after he didn't get along with multiple other castaways. Retrieved from CBS.com Jonathan Libby was born and raised in Dallas, Texas...	0	0	20	2	3	1	2	0.00
20	Tom Westman	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Westman	2	On the first night of the competition, Tom aligned himself with Ian Rosenberger, Katie Gallagher, and Stephenie LaGrossa. The next day, it was revealed that tribes will be formed by Schoolyard Pick and the last two people would go home. Tom was selected by Katie, who was selected by Ian, to be part of what would be the Koror tribe. Tom would pick Janu Tornell to be on the tribe.\n\nAt the inaugural Immunity Challenge on Day 3, Tom suggested to only take the fire making kit, in contrast to Ulong when Jolanda Jones wanted to take as much as possible. Despite their an apparent age disadvantage in contrast to the much collectively younger Ulong, Koror won immunity, flint, and the right to choose camps. With minimal input from the other tribe members, Tom suggested they start anew. Koror's decision to move out proved to be a disastrous one, as they capsized on their way to their new island, ostensibly losing their fire-making kit in the depths of the sea. Reaching their new camp did not help either, as the beach teemed with rats.\n\nTom had become the leader of Koror and one its main providers, along with Ian. At the next Reward Challenge, Tom faced off against Jeff Wilson. Despite a hard-fought battle, Tom lost to Jeff and Koror lost to Ulong. At the Immunity Challenge, Tom lead Koror to another victory. At the next Reward Challenge, both tribes had to pick a representative for building a bathroom. Janu, Coby Archa, and Caryn Groedel all wanted the job, but Tom ignored them in favor of Ian and Gregg. Coby became aware of Tom's Alliance. Koror won the Reward Challenge and the production team remodeled Koror's shelter, which they needed so desperately. At the Immunity Challenge, Tom's opponent was Bobby Jon. The two battled twice, with Tom winning both times. The men of Koror along with Janu won Koror its fourth Immunity Challenge in a row.  Back at camp, Tom had to climb over Willard Smith to tend to the fire. Willard claimed that his age prevented him from helping at camp. Tom viewed this as "Why should I do this when others can do it for me." The next challenge was purely for reward because both tribes had to go to Tribal Council. Koror won again as usual. After the challenge, Tom was quick to nominate Willard for elimination for being the tribe's biggest detriment. He added that Willard can do well in puzzle challenges at the merge and can take one of the seats at Final Tribal Council. The tribe complied and Willard was unanimously voted out. Tom competed in the next Reward Challenge along with Gregg, Coby, and Caryn. They lost to Ulong for the first time in days. However, that would be the paltry group of four win a challenge. Koror won all remaining challenges and reduced Ulong to one person, Stephenie. Coby was becoming more and more aggravated with Tom because he believed that Tom was encouraging the women to act lazy.\n\nOn Day 22, Stephenie arrived at Koror beach with a container. It had a note, explaining that Ulong was conquered and Stephenie is now a member of Koror. Tom remembered his alliance with Stephenie and promised to protect her. A native fisherman came to the group, wanting to teach the group how to fish. Tom was ecstatic because he can interact with the locals and respect them. Coby wanted the other men to spend the night fishing if possible. After bringing back a bountiful booty of fish, the tribe feasted. Tom got drunk on some rum, much to Katie's amusement. Tom won the first individual immunity when everyone else dropped out of the challenge for food. Tribal Council was held immediately after the challenge and Coby was voted out for his dislike of Tom and his alliance revealing the tribe's secrets to Stephenie. Tom, Caryn, Gregg, and Janu won the next Reward Challenge, allowing to them to partake in a traditional Palauan feast. Tom enjoyed interacting with the locals. Janu had to excuse herself from the feast, but she helped herself to the leftovers meant for the others. At the Immunity Challenge, the first castaway to bail would spend the night on a new beach alone called Exile Island. Tom comically considered dropping out to get away from the rats. In the end, Janu opted out first and Tom won his second Immunity Challenge. When Janu returned, she wanted to leave the game. The others (Tom included) wanted Stephenie gone for her athleticism, competitive spirit, and determination to win. When Janu realized this, she laid her torch down to stop them.\n\nAfter Janu left, Stephenie was angered that they were going to send her to the jury rather than someone who wanted to be voted out. Tom calmed Stephenie, even handing her the Immunity Necklace. However, he deemed it his safest option to eliminate the last remaining Ulong member. The final seven gotten envelopes with money in them from Tree Mail, foreshadowing a Survivor Auction. Based on the note that came with it, Tom speculated that more than Food will be sold at the Auction. He was right when Jeff offered letters from home. The letters were the only thing the firefighter and father purchased at the auction. At the Immunity Challenge, Tom did well but accidentally gave Ian the immunity win. Back at camp, Caryn informed him that Stephenie was trying to get the women to vote him out. Tom was confused by this, stating that she was better off with the women. Stephenie was unanimously voted out for her scheming. At the final six Reward Challenge, Tom was the second person out after Caryn. Katie knocked Ian out of the challenge in order to go on reward. Tom and Ian realized with Katie on their side, Gregg and Jenn were planning to eliminate them once Caryn is gone. Tom encouraged the outsider to pretend like she is going home in order to enforce a tie. His fears of the challenge being for Loved Ones were confirmed when the others return with their loved ones. At the Immunity Challenge, Tom made it to the final round against Ian. His poor marksmanship caused him immunity once again. Ian told Katie of the plot, which she was against. Unwilling to force a tie, Katie voted against Gregg, blindsiding him.\n\nBefore the Reward Challenge, Tom recommended to Ian that he pick a woman to join him on the reward if he won, therefore preventing a women's alliance from forming. However, Ian won the Reward Challenge and asked Tom to join him. When he returned, he persuaded Katie to stay loyal. Katie described it as if he was threatening her. Tom resumed his dominance when he won the final five Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council, Caryn revealed that he and Ian were controlling the game. Frightened by this, everyone voted off Caryn, making her the fifth member of the jury. The next Tree Mail had a feast awaiting them. Tom was happy because they had gotten something because they made the final four. Tom beat out Ian to win immunity again. After the challenge, Ian said that it would be a difficult choice for him. Taking this as a sign that Ian would vote him out if he hadn't won immunity, Tom voted against Ian at Tribal Council. This caused a tie, but instead of drawing rocks, Ian and Jenn faced off in a fire-making challenge. Ian won easily, eliminating Jenn from the competition. After Tribal Council, Tom berated Ian for his apparent lack of loyalty, causing him to break down in tears. After the Rites of Passage, the final three competed in their Immunity Challenge. Katie was the first to drop out after about five hours. Tom offered to take Ian to Day 39 if he steps down. Ian refused, saying he wanted to duke it out. Eventually, this guilted ridden Ian offered to step down if Tom took Katie to the final two. Tom still offered Ian a seat at Final Tribal Council, but Ian insisted stating Tom and Katie's friendship meant more to him, and he was willing to make the sacrifice. Tom said that Ian had earned his respect. An impromptu Tribal Council was held, and Tom confirmed Ian's elimination.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, the jury vilified Katie. Tom was not spared from the jury's wrath either. Coby said that Tom played a dirty game, whether he would admit it or not. He would give his vote depending on answers given to the jury. Stephenie felt that Tom didn't protect her enough. Jenn viewed him as a chauvinist and was disrespectful to her. Tom answered the jury's questions and criticism to the best of his ability. He closed his case by saying that "You met the real Tom Westman, good or bad". In the end, Tom won the title of Sole Survivor in a 6-1 vote. Coby voted for Katie because he felt she gave more honest answers.	17	0	1	7	8	4.07	39	0.44
14	Stephenie LaGrossa	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Stephenie_LaGrossa	3	Stephenie started Survivor: Palau with a bang when herself and Jonathan Libby jumped off the boat before any other castaway and tried swimming to win an Immunity Necklace. Unfortunately, Stephenie and her fellow swimmer jumped the gun and were the last ones to the beach. Her obvious athleticism caused her to be picked early in the Schoolyard Pick by Bobby Jon Drinkard, putting her on the Ulong tribe.\n\nStephenie continued to hold her own in challenges, being one of the more athletic members of her tribe. However, Ulong's lack of teamwork caused them to suffer an abysmal losing streak. Stephenie and Ulong first voted out Jolanda Jones for her difficult personality, Ashlee Ashby due to illness and weakness in challenges, Jeff Wilson due to an injured ankle, and Kim Mullen for her uselessness in challenges and at camp.\n\nAt the next Reward Challenge, Ulong lost again, however, both tribes would vote out a member. As part of their reward, the opposing tribe, Koror, granted Ibrehem Rahman with an Immunity Necklace at the vote. Stephenie and her ally Angie Jakusz voted for Bobby Jon which forced a tie between Angie and Bobby Jon. Seeing no other way, Steph was forced to vote out Angie in the revote. Ulong lost yet another challenge and at Tribal Council, Stephenie stuck by James Miller and voted for Ibrehem, causing a tie. Bobby Jon then promised Stephenie that if she switched her vote he wouldn't vote for her at the next Tribal Council. Stephenie trusted him and voted out James. Ulong then lost their sixth straight Immunity Challenge. Thankfully for Stephenie, Bobby Jon stuck to his word and they voted out Ibrehem.\n\nKoror now outnumbered Ulong with eight members to Ulong's two. In a close challenge, Ulong lost for the seventh time. At Tribal Council, Stephenie and Bobby Jon were confused as to how their fate would be decided. Jeff Probst announced that a fire-making challenge would decide which of the two would go on. Stephenie defeated Bobby Jon, eliminating him, and sending her back to camp, alone. The next day, Stephenie got Tree Mail telling her to pack up her things and move to the Koror beach. Ulong had officially been conquered.\n\nStephenie was the obvious outcast at Koror. Coby Archa quickly took her under his wing and informed her of the majority alliance of the tribe. Stephenie came close to winning the first individual Immunity Challenge, but lost to Tom Westman. Fortunately for her, the dominant alliance instead targeted their long-time enemy and threatening player, Coby, voting him out 7-1-1.\n\nThe following Immunity Challenge revealed a weakness in Janu Tornell as she was put on Exile Island for her poor performance. Stephenie's loss seemed to seal her fate, however at Tribal Council Janu announced to Jeff Probst and the tribe that she would be willing to quit in order to spare Stephenie, who showed a greater will to remain in the game. With Ian Rosenberger winning the next Immunity Challenge, Stephenie made a plea to him, Tom, and Caryn Groedel to stay, however, it appeared that Stephenie's time was finally up. Stephenie was voted out unanimously, making her the third member of the jury.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Stephenie cast her vote for Tom to win the game over Katie Gallagher due to his superior strategy and dominance in challenges. Tom won Survivor: Palau in a 6-1 vote.	3	0	7	7	8	5.82	30	0.10

11	Bobby Jon Drinkard	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Bobby_Jon_Drinkard	2	Bobby Jon was chosen by Jolanda Jones to be on the Ulong tribe during the Schoolyard Pick. He jokingly commended her by saying "good choice". Bobby Jon then picked Stephenie LaGrossa to be on the tribe. Ulong lost the first Immunity Challenge and he blamed Angie Jakusz because she was perceived to be the weakest member of the tribe due to being picked last. He campaigned to get Angie out of the tribe but most of the tribe blamed Jolanda for this immunity loss and she was voted out instead.\n\nAt the following Reward Challenge, Ulong won in a landslide. Later, Bobby Jon realized that he judged Angie too quickly and was impressed by her performance in the next challenge. However, despite Ulong seemingly being the physically stronger of the two tribes, they lost every single Immunity Challenge to their rival Koror tribe, sending them to Tribal Council every few days. Bobby Jon was nearly voted out during the Double Tribal Council on Day 12 when he tied with Angie at Tribal Council for the most votes. In the revote, the tribe decided to keep him for his athleticism and work ethic.\n\nAs the days passed, Stephenie formed an alliance with Bobby Jon. They promised each other they would never vote for each other, though she did cast a vote for Bobby Jon on Day 12 before switching to Angie on the revote. He also formed a budding friendship with Ibrehem Rahman who, along with James Miller, shared Alabama as their home state. Ulong won its final Reward Challenge on Day 14 for a trip to Jellyfish Lake. Despite having more in common with the men than Stephanie on the surface, he ultimately decided to vote out James and then Ibrehem in the following Tribal Councils. Ultimately, he and Stephenie were the last two members left from Ulong and lost to Koror for the final time on Day 21. That night at Tribal Council, because there were only two people left, a fire-making challenge was held. Stephenie's flame lit her torch first, eliminating Bobby Jon from the competition in an unusual fashion. The duo said goodbye and Bobby Jon told Stephenie to "win this thing". Host Jeff Probst said before he snuffed Bobby Jon's torch, "The tribe definitely did not speak tonight. Nonetheless, it's time for you to go."	3	0	10	7	6	4.25	21	0.14

18	Danni Boatwright	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Danni_Boatwright	2	Danni started the game on the Nakúm tribe. When it was revealed that Stephenie LaGrossa and Bobby Jon Drinkard were playing a second time, Danni was excited to learn Nakúm would get Bobby Jon. After a grueling eleven-mile hike, the Nakúm tribe reached the better of the two camps first and won flint as well. Despite that, the tribe's strong men were repeatedly vomiting. This weakness showed in the Immunity Challenge, which the Yaxhá tribe won. Danni joined in voting out Jim Lynch, who was seen as the physically weakest of the ailing contestants. Nakúm would bounce back and prove to be the stronger tribe by winning the remaining challenges and earning the tribe fishing supplies and comfort. During the second Immunity Challenge, Danni was able to identify Gary Hogeboom as a former football player.\n\nOn Day 9, both tribes went to a Mayan ruin at what was thought to be a challenge. Instead, host Jeff Probst asked both tribes who was most need of nourishment. Danni and Jamie Newton were seen as the hungriest for their respective tribes and both received apples. As the questions continued, both tribes were asked who had the most tribe pride. Nakúm picked Cindy Hall, and Yaxhá picked Brian Corridan. Jeff then announced a tribe switch and that only Brian and Cindy would stay on their respective tribes. Because Nakúm had an extra member, there would be a drawing of buffs to determine who would stay on Nakúm. Danni went first but drew a blue buff, transferring her to Yaxhá. Brooke Struck went next and she would draw the gold buff, meaning that Bobby Jon, Brandon Bellinger, and Blake Towsley would join Danni and Brian on the new Yaxhá, giving Danni a 4-3 majority. Gary and Amy O'Hara would join them soon after. The group won immunity and the next Reward Challenge, earning them a crocodile-proof swimming pool.\n\nDuring this period, Blake annoyed the group by constantly telling them about his college stories. After losing the Immunity Challenge, Brian used this to his advantage to persuade Danni to vote out Blake over Brian. Realizing she was the swing vote, a position which she hated being in, Danni was concerned about losing her numbers advantage. However, her personality clashed with Blake's, so she blindsided him at their first post-switch Tribal Council. At the next challenge, it was revealed that both tribes would go to Tribal Council that night and that the tribes would compete in a Reward Challenge for a feast. Despite Yaxhá's best efforts, Nakúm won the feast. At camp the former Nakúms targeted Brian for being the most strategic and successfully voted him off. Yaxhá won the next Reward Challenge for a chocolate feast and even invited Nakúm over for a pool party because it was Danni's birthday. Unfortunately, Yaxhá lost the next immunity and would enter the merge without numbers. The tribe voted out Amy for her injured ankle. After Amy's elimination, Jeff announced that the tribes had merged.\n\nThe former Yaxhá tribe walked to the Nakúm camp and woke them up to tell them of the news. The former Nakúm members did not warmly welcome Danni and the other Yaxhás. Lydia Morales named the merged tribe Xhakúm. At the first individual Immunity Challenge, the castaways had a choice to eat or complete for immunity. Danni chose to complete along with Bobby Jon, Brandon, Cindy, Gary, and Judd Sergeant; however, Danni was the first person out. During the challenge, Jamie irritated everyone with his arrogance by telling everyone that Judd and Cindy were there to protect the former Nakúm tribe's numbers advantage. The Yaxhá tried to convince the others to vote out Jamie over Brandon for his arrogance; plus, the fact that Brandon deserved to be in the game more and the Nakúms would still have the numbers. However, the Nakúms held strong and voted off Brandon and then Bobby Jon. Jamie was voted out next for his increasing paranoia. Danni would stay affiliated with Gary, but she kept her options open. He tried to convince the tribe to vote for Judd for being untrustworthy as he lied about the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol. Danni realized that Gary was next to go and rather than trying to turn things around, she conceded and contributed to Gary's unanimous vote out.\n\nDanni was on the chopping block but was still determined to save herself, confident that the majority alliance was ready to turn on each other. At the Survivor Auction, Danni bought herself an advantage at the next Immunity Challenge. Judd bought time to spend with his wife and chose Stephenie and Cindy to join him with their respective loved ones, sending Danni, Lydia, and Rafe Judkins to the former Yaxhá camp. Danni made connections with Rafe and Lydia, even forming a Final Two deal with Rafe. At the challenge, Danni used her advantage and won immunity. Because of this, she was able to convince Rafe to convince Stephenie to turn on Judd. At the final Reward Challenge, Cindy won a car and was given the option of giving cars to the others at the expense of her own car. Cindy kept her car, which angered Rafe. Danni was spared once more due to her deal with Rafe and Cindy's apparent selfishness. At the final four Immunity Challenge, Danni failed to win immunity. However, Danni convinced Rafe that it was in his best interest to keep her over the much physically weaker Lydia as she would take him to the Final Tribal Council. Rafe agreed and Lydia was unanimously voted out. At the Final Immunity Challenge, Danni won and consoled Stephenie who was crying. Seeing Stephenie's tears, Rafe released Danni from their Final Two pact. Danni chose Stephenie to bring to the Final Tribal Council because she viewed Stephenie as easier to beat and as equally deserving as Rafe.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, the jury (except for Rafe, who campaigned for Stephenie due to Danni's decision to vote him out) were convinced to vote for Danni by her honest answers, loyalty, and ability to make it this far despite the Pagonging. Because of that, she won the title of Sole Survivor in a 6-1 vote.	11	0	1	7	8	2.86	39	0.28

10	Bobby Jon Drinkard	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Bobby_Jon_Drinkard	2	Bobby Jon and fellow Palau tribemate Stephenie LaGrossa returned for Survivor: Guatemala, and Bobby Jon was initially placed on the Nakúm tribe. After the opening eleven-mile hike, in spite of Nakúm winning the challenge and the better campsite, Bobby Jon felt very weak and had a hard time moving his legs. In addition, his eyes rolled back in his head while he was resting. Margaret Bobonich, a nurse practitioner by profession, took care of him until he regained his health. Because most of Nakúm's male players got sick after the hike, the tribe lost the first Immunity Challenge and voted out the injured Jim Lynch at Tribal Council.\n\nDuring the Tribe Switch on Day 12, Bobby Jon, along with Blake Towsley, Brandon Bellinger, and Danni Boatwright, were all swapped to the Yaxhá tribe. The former Nakúm members held the majority over the original Yaxhá members, but they lost it when Bobby Jon and Danni voted against Blake for his obnoxious behavior at camp concerning his fraternity stories.\n\nBobby Jon, Danni, and Brandon voted with Gary Hogeboom to eliminate former Yaxhá members Brian Corridan and Amy O'Hara, narrowly missing being eliminated. Some of his tribemates believed that he did not deserve a second chance since they were all on their first one.\n\nThe tribes then merged into the new Xhakúm tribe on Night 18. The Yaxhá Alliance was down in numbers and Bobby Jon was targeted for being a huge physical threat. However, Bobby Jon appealed to Stephenie to at least allow him to make it to the jury this time. Stephenie and the Nakúm Alliance obliged and Brandon was voted out at Tribal Council, securing Bobby Jon's spot on the jury. After the next Immunity Challenge, the Nakúm Alliance set their sights on eliminating Gary. However, when Gary revealed at Tribal Council that he had found the Hidden Immunity Idol and used it on himself, the majority was forced to change their plans. They ultimately voted for Bobby Jon, who was thus made the first jury member.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, he voted for his ally Danni to win.	8	0	9	7	6	3	24	0.33
17	Stephenie LaGrossa	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Stephenie_LaGrossa	3	Stephenie started the game on the Yaxhá tribe, which started a short losing streak. She was immediately afraid of her past Survivor experience recurring, but Yaxhá won the next Immunity Challenge. Stephenie built strong bonds with Rafe Judkins and Jamie Newton. During a surprise tribe switch, her, Rafe, Jamie, and Lydia Morales were switched to Nakúm, which also consisted of four original Nakúm members. Stephenie and Jamie convinced Judd Sergeant to flip on his former tribe and vote out Brooke Struck. Stephenie's new tribe continued to win immunity, only going to Tribal Council and eliminating Margaret Bobonich because of a double Tribal Council twist.\n\nStephenie's alliance, which consisted of her, Rafe, Jamie, Lydia, Judd, and Cindy Hall entered the merge with numbers over the new Yaxhá tribe. After promising Bobby Jon Drinkard a spot on the jury, Stephenie and her alliance voted out Brandon Bellinger and then Bobby Jon himself after Gary Hogeboom played a Hidden Immunity Idol. Instead of continuing to eliminate the rival alliance, Rafe wanted to blindside Jamie for being paranoid and wanting to go the Final Two with Judd. Stephenie reluctantly agreed and aided in voting her close ally out. Judd was shocked but maintained his loyalty. The alliance was then back on track and voted out Gary, leaving Danni Boatwright as the only remaining alliance member left.\n\nAfter a Survivor Auction where Danni bought an advantage to the Immunity Challenge, Judd bought the family reward and invited Stephenie, Cindy, and their respective loved ones on it. Stephenie promised Judd's wife that she would go to the Final Two with him. Danni won individual immunity, forcing Stephenie to eliminate another member of her own alliance. She decided to vote off Judd, citing his multiple lies as justification. After he was blindsided, he was clearly angry, and another ally Stephenie burned.\n\nCindy was not informed of the Judd blindside and felt vulnerable. After she kept a car reward for herself rather than giving a car to Stephenie, Rafe, Lydia, and Danni and then picking Stephenie to go on reward with her, Rafe was angry. He made a pact with Danni to go to the final three with her, and when Stephenie returned from the reward, Rafe informed her that he wanted to eliminate Cindy. Cindy was then voted out, and Stephenie took most of the heat again.\n\nAt the final four, Rafe wanted to stay true to his bond with Danni and eliminate Lydia. Stephenie thought Danni was a bigger threat, but did not want to upset her closest ally, Rafe, and helped him in voting her out. Danni won the Final Immunity Challenge, and Rafe released her of her promise to bring him to the Final Two. Danni brought Stephenie, which angered Rafe. Stephenie only received Rafe's vote and was named runner-up to Danni.	6	0	2	7	8	4.5	39	0.15

16	Aras Baskauskas	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Aras_Baskauskas	2	Originally part of the younger male Viveros tribe, Aras and the rest of the tribe struggled early on, as the group of younger men was unable to set up camp, nor make fire. Their goofing off and foolishness almost carried over at the first Immunity Challenge, narrowly beating the older women Casaya tribe, finishing third place and avoiding Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 4, Aras became a member of the new Casaya tribe and formed an early alliance with Shane Powers, Courtney Marit, and Danielle DiLorenzo. But the alliance was threatened with implosion when Shane wanted to quit the game, having smoked three packets of cigarettes a day prior to Survivor. But Aras convinced him not to quit, and the alliance regrouped and voted out Melinda Hyder, one of the two older women of the tribe. The dysfunctional Casaya tribe would then win two consecutive Immunity Challenges.\n\nAras led the charge to vote out Bruce Kanegai due to their clashing points of view, but Courtney, Danielle, and Cirie Fields felt that Bobby Mason was much more of a threat than Bruce, and they voted Bobby out. When the tribes merged into the Gitanos tribe in Day 16, the ex-Casaya tribe members, Aras, Shane, Bruce, Cirie, Courtney, and Danielle had the power in numbers against the four ex-La Mina tribe members. Due to Terry Deitz, the largest target, winning immunity, the alliance voted out Nick Stanbury, Austin Carty, and Sally Schumann in three straight Tribal Councils.\n\nOn Day 25, Bruce was evacuated out of the game due to constipation, causing him immense pain. When Terry continued to win individual immunity, the alliance was forced to turn on themselves at the final six. Shane, together with Cirie and Aras, targeted Danielle, but Courtney, together with Terry, Danielle, and Cirie wanted to vote out Aras. Not happy with any of these options, Cirie brewed a plan of her own, and together with Aras and Danielle, voted out Courtney, whom Cirie believed was aligned with Shane.\n\nTerry continued his immunity winning streak and once again the alliance was forced to take out one of their own. Shane, believing he was safe, targeted Danielle. But once again, Cirie had her own plans, and together with Aras and Danielle, they voted out Shane, who had aligned with Terry. At the final four, the long-standing rivalry between Terry and Aras was once again raised when Aras won a Reward Challenge, much to Terry's dismay. When given the choice of picking someone to go on the reward with him to cross the Panama Canal, he decided to pick Cirie, which in turn sent both Terry and Danielle to Exile Island. When sent to Exile Island, Terry and Danielle formed an alliance against Aras and Cirie with plans of ousting Aras.\n\nHowever, Aras managed to win immunity, making him safe. Terry, due to the widely-known fact that he possessed the Hidden Immunity Idol, was also safe. This created a 2-2 tie between Danielle and Cirie, who competed in a fire-building challenge to determine their fate. Shown over two episodes, Danielle won the challenge, and Aras's ally Cirie was eliminated. With Terry's idol now useless, it was now fair game between the final three, Aras, Danielle, and Terry.\n\nThe Final Immunity Challenge was the first to be preceded by a "prepare for the Immunity Challenge" reward for the Reward Challenge winner. The Immunity Challenge was not one that the winner of the Reward Challenge would profit from. At the Final Immunity Challenge, Danielle out-balanced the two guys to win immunity, giving her the ability to choose her opponent in the Final Two. Danielle eventually chose to eliminate Terry, making him the final member of the jury and propelling Aras into the Final Two. The challenge ended the perceived battle between both Terry and Aras.\n\nOn Day 39, while he and Danielle had glasses of champagne, Aras slipped on a wet rock and fell, sending shards of glass into his hand and back. His wounds required seven stitches by the medical crew.\n\nIn the end, despite the injury, Aras beat out Danielle to become the Sole Survivor in a 5-2 vote, gaining the votes of Austin, Sally, Courtney, Cirie, and Terry.	10	0	1	8	7	3.57	39	0.26
15	Danielle DiLorenzo	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Danielle_DiLorenzo	2	Being 24 at the time, Danielle was placed on the Bayoneta tribe, which consisted of younger women. Danielle was pumped when she learned that they had a challenge right off the bat. She would represent the tribe for the challenge. However, Danielle came in last and one of the younger women had to be on Exile Island. Danielle said that she should be "exiled" because she lost the challenge. However, the other girls decided to do rock-paper-scissors to decides who stays. That person would be Misty Giles. When the women arrived at the campsite, they had a hard time deciding where to build the shelter. This annoyed Sally Schumann. Courtney Marit found a dead sea turtle and associated with motherhood. Danielle thought Courtney was dramatizing stuff and viewed the sea turtle as dead. Despite the problems at camp, the women rallied together to place first at the Immunity Challenge.\n\nOn the morning of Day 4, Courtney and Sally managed to get papaya for the tribe. Later, the castaways gather and all of them stand on a disc. The one Danielle picked had a purple buff under it, making her the captain in a Schoolyard Pick for the Casaya tribe. Her first pick was "The cool dude with the Boston Tattoo" (Shane Powers). He would pick Courtney to be on the new tribe. Casaya lost the immediate Reward Challenge to La Mina. Cirie Fields showed the newcomers around the Casaya camp. Shane quickly gathered Danielle, Courtney, and Aras Baskauskas to form an alliance. Casaya lost the Immunity Challenge. Shane announced he wanted to quit, shocking his alliance. Aras was able to calm Shane down. However, Aras told Cirie and Melinda Hyder to their faces that one of them was going to be voted out. Despite disagreeing with Aras telling the women they were being voted out, Melinda was voted out in a 5-2 vote. Bruce Kanegai would then replace her on the tribe.\n\nBruce immediately offered up his knowledge of wilderness experience to the tribe. He made a filtration system for water and he boosted the morale of the tribe. However, Bruce was exiled again when La Mina won the Reward Challenge. Shane later yelled at Courtney and Danielle about sitting in his thinking seat. In the Immunity Challenge, Danielle competed in the first and final rounds of the challenge. She and her partners in the rounds were able to win and give Casaya its first victory. This would be the start of a winning streak for Casaya. This did not gloss over the intertribal dynamics. Danielle and Courtney would still get in conflict with Shane, like over the former's lack of work ethic. Danielle was annoyed with Bobby Mason when he used the bathroom when it was decided to be used as a storage shed for the firewood. She was also frustrated by Bobby's lack of gentlemanly behavior.\n\nOn Day 12, After winning the Reward Challenge, Casaya returned to a flooded camp. Bruce cut the fish that was won in the challenge like sashimi. At the next Immunity Challenge, La Mina finally ended its losing streak. Shane was quick to nominate Bobby because of fears he would flip to his original Viveros tribemates on La Mina (which Bobby said he would do when in the outhouse, drinking wine with Bruce). However, Aras changed the target to Bruce under the argument that they can't control him. Not liking this, Danielle convinced the women to vote out Bobby. They tried to get Shane, but he already swore to Bobby on his son's life that he was going to the final six. At Tribal Council, the women got their way and Bobby was voted out in 3-2-1-1 vote. After Tribal Council when the tribe was asleep, Shane scolded Danielle for voting personally and wanted out of the alliance. She told him to shut up and they will talk about this in the morning. Later, Shane asked to have his son's name back and be released from the alliance, which the girls quickly agreed to. The challenge was for both immunity and a trip to a local village. Casaya was able to win due to La Mina botching the puzzle. Danielle enjoyed seeing the smiles of the kids' faces. Shane also apologized for his behavior.\n\nWhen they returned, Courtney and Danielle wanted Shane out. The tribes merged. The men from La Mina, Terry Deitz, Nick Stanbury, and Austin Carty, were rowing towards the Casaya beach. The tribe quickly ate the rice they had and Shane rallied them against La Mina. Sally soon arrived from Exile Island. The main target, La Mina's leader, Terry, won immunity. After debating their options, Casaya voted out Nick in a 6-4 vote. At the next Reward Challenge, Danielle was teamed with Cirie and Courtney. They fell behind early and couldn't catch up. The women helped the team of Aras, Bruce, and Sally win the challenge though. However, Danielle was exiled along with Austin. Torrential rains make life miserable for the pair. However, they soon find something in common and become friends. At the Immunity Challenge, Danielle was eliminated in the second round, ultimately ending with Terry winning immunity. La Mina tried to get her and Bruce to flip, pointing out that Shane said that they would be the first two to go when the former La Mina is gone. Terry even offered to give Danielle his Hidden Immunity Idol. Despite the offer, Danielle and Bruce stayed with Casaya and voted out Austin.\n\nDanielle wondered if the idol that Terry showed her was real or not. The next Reward Challenge was for videos from home and PB&J sandwiches. Danielle was teamed with Aras, Cirie, and Shane. Because of some mishaps, Danielle's team lost. Shane tried to cheer up the women by saying the challenge was a big one to lose. The winners also received their Luxury Items, upsetting Danielle further. At the Immunity Challenge, the castaways were given the option of competing or eating burgers and fries. Like most of her alliance, Danielle chose to eat. Terry won his third Immunity Challenge in a row. At Tribal Council, Danielle says that there is going to be a challenge that Terry can't win. Casaya then proceeded to vote out Sally.\n\nAt the next Tree Mail, the tribe received dolls for the Reward Challenge, the three strikes challenge (In this case, the questions were based on the tribe's opinion of one another). At the Reward Challenge, Danielle was deemed to do the least for the tribe. She was the third person knocked out of the challenge. Cirie won the challenge and brought Aras and Danielle because they would be the most fun to be with. While at reward, the trio laughed at Courtney's reactions during the challenge and her relationship with Shane. They also pitied Bruce who had stomach pains and had to deal with Shane and Courtney's arguing. When the trio returned, they learned that Bruce had to leave camp due to constipation. It was later revealed that Bruce would not be returning to the game.\n\nDanielle thought that Shane's BlackBerry (a piece of wood) was crazy. Danielle, along with Courtney and Terry won the Reward Challenge for a barbecue. The trio also participated in a second Reward Challenge for a car, which Terry won. Terry tried to form a final three alliance with the women. Courtney was on board, but Danielle had her reservations. She talked to Terry and agreed that the person who places last at the Final Immunity Challenge would be voted out. Danielle was the third person out of the challenge, which Terry won. Danielle would become the deciding vote between Aras and Courtney. Danielle cast the pivotal vote against Courtney, blindsiding her. Danielle received a vote from Shane, who was under the false pretense that she was going out.\n\nAt the Reward Challenge, the winner would decide how the castaways would spend time with their Loved Ones. Danielle was the third out of the challenge, that Terry won. In retaliation for not voting with him, Terry exiled Danielle and prevented her from interacting with her mom. Although the weather was much more pleasant, she was still disappointed that she didn't get to spent time with her mom. Terry set a record by winning five Immunity Challenges in a row. Aras came to Danielle and said he is done with Shane due to him wanting to take Courtney to the final two. Danielle received Shane's vote, while he was blindsided. At the next Reward Challenge, Aras won. He chose to bring Cirie with him, causing Danielle and Terry to be exiled. Because of Aras' decision, Danielle decided to align herself with Terry. They form a final two pact and would vote out Aras next. However, things were complicated when Aras won immunity. Anticipating a tie between herself and Cirie, Danielle tried to get Terry to give her the idol. However, all he did was give her firemaking tips. Fortunately, Danielle was able to beat Cirie in the tiebreaker challenge, eliminating the latter.\n\nIn the final Reward Challenge, Danielle was unable to keep up with the men. Terry won that challenge and received a meal and a night's rest on a cot to nourish him for the Final Immunity Challenge. Aras talked to Danielle and told her that one of them must win the Final Immunity Challenge to vote out Terry. Danielle believed the challenge was about willpower and she wouldn't give up. At the Rites of Passage, the final three burned the skull on Exile Island. Danielle won the Final Immunity Challenge. Not expecting to be in his position, Danielle had a hard choosing who to take to the finals with her. Both men made their cases to her. At Tribal Council, Danielle decided to vote out Terry. On Day 39, Aras hurt himself while walking on the beach. Danielle was grossed out by the wound when it was treated.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Danielle said in her opening statement that she wanted to be herself and do the best she could do. She added that she hoped that the jury makes the right decision. In the end, Danielle lost the game to Aras in a 5-2 vote. She earned the votes of Bruce because of their bond and Shane because of guessing a closer number to his.	8	0	2	7	8	3	39	0.21
14	Terry Deitz	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Terry_Deitz	2	Being 46 years of age at time of play, Terry was placed on the La Mina, a tribe which consisted of older men. Terry was selected to run the first challenge, he was the first person to find an amulet and got flint for his tribe. He formed a bond with fellow tribe member Dan Barry as both share an history of aeronautics. Both men, along with Bruce Kanegai, worked hard at camp, leaving Shane Powers feeling left out. At the first Immunity Challenge, La Mina placed second, keeping them safe from Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 4, the four tribes integrated into two. Terry got the orange buff and was the captain of the new La Mina. His first selection was Sally Schumann. At the next Immunity Challenge, the new La Mina tribe won, keeping them safe. They also won the Reward Challenge and the right to exile a member of the new Casaya tribe. La Mina chose to exile Bruce to demoralize the opposing tribe. However, Casaya bounced back and won the next immunity. Although Ruth Marie Milliman was considered the physically weakest, the men of La Mina eliminated Misty Giles for her poor performance and possibly having the Hidden Immunity Idol. Casaya went on a winning streak, and they chose to exile Terry twice. During his time on Exile Island, he found the idol. La Mina managed to break Casaya's streak temporarily, but Casaya won a joint Reward/Immunity Challenge on Day 15. Casaya chose to exile Sally, which would also abstain her from the vote. With the intended target immune, Terry joined Austin Carty and Nick Stanbury in ousting Dan.\n\nOn Day 17, the tribes merged into the Gitanos tribe and the former La Mina was outnumbered 6-4. Terry tried to get Bruce, Shane, Cirie Fields, and Danielle DiLorenzo to flip. The Casaya Alliance, however, held strong and targeted Terry, but he won consecutive immunities, keeping him safe. However, he had no choice but to watch his fellow La Mina Alliance members Nick, Austin, an Sally be voted out. At the final six, Terry tried to get Courtney Marit under his wing. After winning immunity again, Terry targeted his rival Aras Baskauskas and believed he was going home. However, Cirie started noticing Terry aligning with Courtney. Viewing this as Terry getting insurance for the Final Two, Cirie arranged for Courtney's elimination.\n\nOn Day 33, Terry tied a record when he won his fifth individual Immunity Challenge in a row and Shane was voted out to prevent Terry from aligning with him. When returning from camp later that night, Cirie left her torch on the ground, causing Terry to trip over it causing an argument between the two, but Aras defended Cirie telling Terry it was simply an accident. At the final four, Aras won the Reward Challenge. Despite Terry's protests, Aras chose to bring along Cirie, automatically exiling Terry and Danielle. Danielle decided to align with Terry and conspire to eliminate Aras, though this plot was foiled when Aras won immunity. Despite Danielle's pleas, Terry refused to give her the idol, meaning its powers had gone to waste, forcing Danielle to face Cirie in a fire-making tiebreaker at Tribal Council, which Danielle narrowly won. On Day 37, Terry won an advantage at the Final Immunity Challenge. Despite that, Terry was the first to fall in the challenge, with Danielle winning immunity. Despite teaching Danielle how to make fire, Danielle did not hold her end of the deal and voted out Terry, making him the seventh and final member of the jury.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Terry gave his vote to Aras, likely in retaliation for Danielle's betrayal.\n\nAt the live Reunion Show, host Jeff Probst polled the jury on who would have voted for Terry had he made it to the final two instead of Aras and 5 of the 7 jurors raised their hands, meaning he would have won if he and Danielle made it to the Final Two.	16	1	3	8	9	4.07	38	0.42
13	Cirie Fields	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Cirie_Fields	4	Being one of the four eldest female contestants, Cirie was initially placed on the purple Casaya tribe. Coming into the game, Cirie had little outdoor experience and even claimed to have a certain "fear of leaves". However, her social skills and strategic gameplay would take her far.\n\nAfter losing the first Immunity Challenge, Cirie's lack of athleticism put her in line for elimination. She quickly formed an alliance with Melinda Hyder and Ruth Marie Milliman to vote out Tina Scheer, the most productive member of the Casaya tribe, yet a social recluse. At Tribal Council, Tina accused her tribemates of underworking, prompting Melinda and Ruth Marie to question her. Cirie's efforts paid off, and she succeeded in eliminating Tina from the game in a 3-1 vote.\n\nOn Day 4, the four tribes merged into two, Cirie, though staying on the Casaya tribe with ally Melinda, again found herself on the outside, this time, of a four-person alliance consisting of Aras Baskauskas, Courtney Marit, Danielle DiLorenzo, and Shane Powers. After losing the next Immunity Challenge, Shane told Cirie and Melinda outright that whoever did not go home between at the next vote would go next. Despite both's vulnerability, Cirie and Melinda honored their bond with each other and did not campaign against one another. When Cirie noticed Shane's rampant mood swings as cancer to the tribe, she used this as an opening to break their alliance. At Tribal Council, though Cirie and Melinda both voted against Shane, Melinda was ultimately ousted, leaving Cirie as the only older woman in her tribe.\n\nOver the next few days, the already-dysfunctional Casaya tribe began to self-destruct, and Cirie sat back and watched the drama unfold between the majority alliance, with Shane's volatile personality continuing to grate on his alliance partners. The dysfunction, however, was put aside when needed to, as Casaya managed to win the next two Immunity Challenges, giving Cirie time to fully develop her social game and attempt to work her way into the graces of the ruling Casaya Alliance. When Casaya finally lost an Immunity Challenge on Day 14, the decision of whom to boot came down to Bobby Mason and Bruce Kanegai, two other outsiders. Bruce was the original target, but the Casaya women, led by Danielle, decided to vote out Bobby. At Tribal Council, Bobby was voted out in a scattered 3-2-1-1 vote, which accurately depicted the tribe's lack of unity. Cirie was one of only three people in her tribe to not receive a vote at that Tribal Council, proving Shane's earlier words that Cirie would be next to go wrong.\n\nThe next day, Shane wanted to leave the alliance of four. He asked if he could take his son's name back because he had sworn allegiance to the group by that. Courtney and Danielle gladly released him from his promise and decided to vote him out at the next Tribal Council. However, after winning the next combined Reward/Immunity Challenge, the alliance began to get along again, to Cirie's disappointment. However, Cirie was adopted by the majority alliance prior to the arrival of the rival La Mina tribe for the merge.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Gitanos tribe on Day 16, the Casaya Alliance had a 6-4 voting advantage over the La Mina Alliance and planned to eliminate them to their last member. When Terry Deitz tried to offer Cirie a deal, she rejected it, stating he "was not in the position to offer anything". As Terry kept winning Immunity Challenges, Cirie and the rest of Casaya Alliance voted out his La Mina allies Nick Stanbury, Austin Carty, and Sally Schumann one by one.\n\nOn Day 25, Cirie won the Reward Challenge, choosing to bring Aras and Danielle with her on a spa experience, much to Shane's disappointment. Later that night, Bruce had to be medically evacuated due to severe blockage in his digestive system, leaving only six castaways in the game. The three returned to camp the following day, shocked to learn of Bruce's evacuation. Cirie later made amends with Shane, with the two swearing on their children to solidify their alliance.\n\nWhen Terry once again won immunity on Day 30, the Casaya Alliance was forced to vote out one of their own. Cirie felt worried that Shane and Terry wanted to take Courtney to the Final Tribal Council for an easy win because of her unpopularity, as revealed in the previous Reward Challenge, which revealed everyone's perception of each other. Courtney, Danielle, and Terry schemed to vote out Aras, but Cirie managed to flip Danielle to her side. Shane thought the plan was to vote out Danielle, and Cirie left him out of the loop. At Tribal Council, Courtney was voted out in a 3-2-1 vote, all due to Cirie's planning. From this point forward, while her strategy continued to pay off, her survival skills also improved, as she caught a large fish all by herself, which Terry claimed as the biggest fish ever caught by the tribe, much to Cirie's delight.\n\nAfter Terry won the next Reward Challenge, which had a family visit up for grabs, he chose Cirie to get a visit from her husband, H.B., who was able to spend a day on the island with the castaways. H.B. was amazed at how his wife was doing at camp, stating that he was seeing a different side of Cirie that he never saw before. At the next Tribal Council, Cirie, Aras, and Danielle voted out Shane, once again blindsiding both Shane and Terry, who had planned on making the final three together.\n\nWhen returning from camp later that night, Cirie left her torch on the ground, causing Terry to trip over it instigating an argument between the two. Aras defended Cirie, telling Terry it was simply an accident. Cirie and Aras now planned to take each other to the Final Two. While Aras took Cirie on a trip down the Panama Canal after winning the next Reward Challenge, Danielle and Terry were stuck to endure Exile Island together, where the two made a pact to the Final Two. After Aras won the next Immunity Challenge, Cirie and Danielle were targeted by the other duo and decided to settle the score with a tiebreaker challenge. Meanwhile, trying her best to forgo the deal, Danielle begged Terry to give her his still-unused Hidden Immunity Idol, but when Terry refused to, the vote was deadlocked between Cirie and Danielle. The two faced off in a fire-building tiebreaker. After a lively competition, Danielle won, eliminating Cirie from the game and making her the sixth member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Cirie cast her vote for Aras, who went on to win the game over Danielle in a 5-2 vote.\n\nAt the live Reunion Show, a viewer's poll revealed that Cirie was the most popular contestant of the season, winning herself a car, a GMC Yukon.	7	0	4	9	8	5	36	0.19

Immediately, Rebecca claimed that tribal divisions by race were a great way to disprove common stereotypes.\n\nWithin the first few days of being on the tribe, Rebecca quickly developed a bond with tribe member Sundra Oakley. The two were inseparable and tribe members quickly commented on how close the two had been getting. When Manihiki lost the first challenge, Rebecca's tribe had to face the vote. Stephannie Favor quickly became the swing vote between the men and the women. Rebecca managed to convince Stephannie that Sekou Bunch was the weakest link and, at Tribal Council, Rebecca, Sundra, and Stephannie eliminated Sekou.\n\nThe tribe continued to work hard at camp; Rebecca and Stephannie finally managed to make fire on Day 4. Tribe outsider Nate Gonzalez did the majority of the work to prove he was worth keeping. At the Immunity Challenge on Day 5, Manihiki was trailing but managed to claim third place due to Aitutaki wanting to throw the challenge. On Day 7 , the Manihiki tribe was no more and Rebecca was chosen by Cristina Coria to be on the new Rarotonga tribe, along with Stephannie. During the next Immunity Challenge, Rebecca was seen as an asset when Jeff Probst identified her as the last woman remaining in the challenge. Rebecca helped lead her tribe to win the challenge and win immunity.\n\nUnfortunately, Rarotonga was not able to continue winning as they lost the next Reward Challenge and the next Immunity Challenge. After the Immunity Challenge, Rebecca's ally Stephannie openly told the tribe that she was the weakest link and would understand if she was voted out at Tribal Council. Rebecca was not comfortable with voting out Stephannie, so she asked her if she wanted to go home, which Stephannie said no to. Rebecca came up with a plan to blindside J.P. Calderon, who was annoying the tribe. She rallied the women to create an alliance. Some of the women seemed hesitant to keep Stephannie, so Rebecca brought Brad Virata and Adam Gentry into the alliance. At Tribal Council, Rebecca's plan worked, and J.P. was blindsided.\n\nDuring "Don't Cry Over Spilled Octopus", Cristina Coria began to annoy Rebecca and the rest of the tribe, and, when Rarotonga lost the Immunity Challenge, she became an instant target. Rebecca was set with voting Cristina out, but, when Nate told the tribe that Stephannie had told him that she wanted to go home, Rebecca changed her vote. At Tribal Council, Rebecca's ally, Stephannie was voted out.\n\nIn "Plan Voodoo", Rebecca was surprised to learn that both tribes would be visiting Tribal Council. Rebecca rallied for Cristina to be eliminated, as she was still causing trouble at camp. Cristina asked Rebecca for another chance, saying she would be useful to the tribe if they kept her. Despite Cristina's lobbying, Rebecca still joined the tribe in voting her out.\n\nRebecca cost her tribe the Reward Challenge in "Why Aren't You Swimming?!", but was able to make up for it by helping the tribe win the following Immunity Challenge. In Mutiny, Rebecca chose to stay on Rarotonga, and the tribe gained Jonathan Penner and Candice Woodcock as new tribe members. Rebecca wanted to eliminate Jonathan first because he was untrustworthy, but, when Rarotonga lost the Immunity Challenge, she joined the tribe in voting out Brad, who openly told the tribe that he doesn't trust them. When Rarotonga lost the Immunity Challenge in "People That You Like Want to See You Suffer", she once again targeted Jonathan, unaware that she was being targeted for her weakness in challenges. Rebecca thought that the message in a bottle the tribe received after the Immunity Challenge would signal a merge. She did not get to find out what the message said because, at Tribal Council, Rebecca was eliminated for her weakness in challenges. Rebecca placed 11th overall and became the second member of the jury.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Rebecca congratulated the finalists and stated she was torn between Yul Kwon's strategy and Ozzy Lusth's athleticism. Rebecca asked both men why they deserve the title from the money. Yul said his reason was the fact that ethnic minorities was under represented by the media and he wanted to be a good spokesperson for Asian-American men. Ozzy said he was there also to change the perception of Mexicans. Rebecca gave her jury vote to Ozzy, who lost the title of Sole Survivor to Yul in a close 5-4-0 vote.	4	0	11	8	7	0.6	24	0.17

Once the Aitutonga tribe was formed, Parvati was relegated in the minority along with allies Adam Gentry and Candice Woodcock following the betrayal of Jonathan Penner. In an effort to save herself, Parvati convinced the leader of the Aitu Four, Yul Kwon, to eliminate Jonathan before herself and Adam in exchange for their Jury votes. Despite getting her way, she was the penultimate member of her alliance to be voted out because she was believed to be a bigger threat than Adam.	7	0	6	9	8	1.8	36	0.19

13	Candice Woodcock	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Candice_Woodcock	3	Candice started the game on the Caucasian Rarotonga tribe, where she became quick friends with all of her tribemates, notably Parvati Shallow, love interest Adam Gentry, and Jonathan Penner. Though Raro would win every Immunity Challenge during the four-tribe phase of the game, Candice did attract controversy at the end of the Immunity Challenge on Day 6. Realizing he would be next to go from the Aitutaki tribe, Billy Garcia whispered his predicament to Candice. Candice told him "we love you" ("we" as in Rarotonga), which Billy misinterpreted as "I love you", and so Billy told Candice he loved her in response. At Tribal Council that night, Billy told both his tribe and Jeff Probst that his prize from the game was falling in love with Candice, although no one took him seriously.\n\nOn Day 7, Candice was switched to the Aitu tribe, alongside Jonathan and Jessica Smith (nicknamed Flicka). Though she was sent to Exile Island ahead of the group's first Tribal Council, Jonathan was able to secure Candice's position within the group, creating a four-way alliance with original Manihiki memners Yul Kwon and Becky Lee. Following her return, Candice remained loyal to her new allies, eliminating both Cao Boi Bui and Flicka.\n\nOn Day 19, Jeff Probst offered the castaways the opportunity to mutiny from one tribe to another. Wanting to reconnect with her allies Adam and Parvati, Candice quickly mutinied from Aitu and was followed by Jonathan, much to the fury of her remaining Aitu tribemates. Though Candice was able to reestablish her friendships with Adam and Parvati and survive several votes, Aitu's winning streak would result in Candice being sent to Exile Island multiple times as punishment for her betrayal.\n\nOn Day 25, Candice joined the newly merged Aitutonga tribe. Though Candice's Raro Alliance held a 5-4 majority over the Aitu Four, Jonathan was convinced to flip on Raro by Yul after he showed him his Hidden Immunity Idol, eliminating Candice's ally Nate Gonzalez at Tribal Council. Now in the minority, Candice and her remaining allies attempted to turn the Aitu Four against Jonathan for his dishonesty. In the end though, Candice's pleas fell on deaf ears and she was eliminated in a 5-3 vote on Day 30. After kissing Adam on her way out of Tribal Council, Candice became the fifth member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Candice pointed out that Yul was dancing around the jurors questions and said she only wanted a yes or no answer or he would lose her vote. Candice asked Yul if he felt any shame in how he worked the jury. After some hesitation, Yul said yes. Yul almost explained himself but Candice stopped him, pointing out he broke her rule. Despite that mistake, Candice voted for Yul to win the title of Sole Survivor, crucial in allowing him to defeat Ozzy Lusth in a close 5-4-0 vote.	7	0	8	7	8	1.2	30	0.23
20	Yul Kwon	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Yul_Kwon	2	Yul began the competition as part of the green Puka Puka (nicknamed "Puka") tribe, which was entirely comprised of Asian-Americans. When the tribes marooned off the Cook Islands, the four racially divided tribes scoured the ship for supplies. Frantic as everybody, Yul got distracted by all the commotion, causing the chicken he was holding to escape, only to end up in the hands of another contestant, Jonathan Penner.\n\nFour to five days in, Yul immediately began a friendly bond with tribemate Becky Lee, which would eventually blossom as a formidable alliance of two, while slightly became distant to another tribemate, Cao Boi Bui, whose "Asian jokes" silently aggravated the other tribe members, Jenny Guzon-Bae and Brad Virata. Any strategies within Puka Puka were put on hold, as the green tribe won two consecutive Reward/Immunity Challenges. On Day 5, Yul was sent to Exile Island, where he solved the clues to a broken compass, which was revealed as the Hidden Immunity Idol, giving him a high degree of power.\n\nWhen the four tribes became two on Day 7, Yul, Becky, and Cao Boi were transferred to the new Aitutaki tribe, along with members from the other three original tribes. Yul bought time to expand his alliance, adding former Rarotonga members Jonathan, who happened to be the only other person to be sent to Exile Island at the time, and Candice Woodcock. After losing the subsequent Immunity Challenge, an added twist that sent Candice to Exile Island ruined Yul's plans to take his new alliance in motion. To make up for Candice's absence, Yul improvised by convincing Cao Boi and Jessica Smith to eliminate Cecilia Mansilla. The new Aitutaki tribe later enjoyed a lengthy winning streak, winning four of the next five challenges.\n\nAfter a double elimination twist that would forcibly send Aitutaki to Tribal Council, Yul was approached by Cao Boi, who presented a plan which he called "Plan Voodoo." The salon owner speculated that Jonathan had the Hidden Immunity Idol and that there was a budding "Whites' Alliance" once the Caucasian contestants would be reunited at the merge. As a solution, Cao Boi proposed that the vote should end up a 3-3 tie between Candice and Jonathan to nullify any power obtained by playing the idol. While oblivious of the fact that Yul was the true owner of the idol, this, and his eccentric personality caused Cao Boi's "Plan Voodoo" to backfire, sending him home and keeping Yul's alliance intact. When Rarotonga finally broke Aitutaki's winning streak, Yul joined in sending Jessica home for being an alliance outsider.\n\nOn Day 20, the castaways were given the chance to mutiny. Candice and Jonathan took the opportunity, leaving only Yul, Becky, Sundra Oakley, and Ozzy Lusth, who was the next intended target. Despite the numbers disadvantage, the Aitu Four rallied together to win the remaining challenges, and would punish Candice at every opportunity by sending her to Exile Island for her betrayal. The Aitu Four would enter the merge with five Raros and needing someone to flip, and Yul turn towards Jonathan to flip back to Aitu. After showing him the Hidden Immunity Idol, Jonathan agreed and would like to vote off Nate Gonzalez instead, trusting him the least. Yul agreed and Jonathan flipped to the Aitu side, resulting in Nate being blindsided.\n\nYul revealed his idol to the tribe at the Survivor Auction. After the remaining Raros, including Jonathan, were voted out, Yul was in the final four, with his alliance. During this time, Yul realized that he was being viewed as the brains of this operation and how he sent players to the jury mattered. This resulted in him posturing to the eventual members of the jury by agreeing to Adam's request for Jonathan to go before him and also bringing Jonathan's hat back to Tribal Council following his blindside. On Day 38, a Tree Mail stated to perform the Rites of Passage and proceed to the Final Immunity Challenge. Confused by this, Jeff revealed that this season would feature a Final Three for the first time at Final Tribal Council instead of the usual Final Two. Although unable to win immunity, his Hidden Immunity Idol kept him safe. He offered the idol to Becky, but she rejected it stating it was only fair to enter a tiebreaker between Becky and Sundra after all they've been through.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Yul explained his strategy and also revealed how much it meant for him to be a part of this season as he grew up with few Asian American role models on television. When Candice asked him about playing the jury, Yul's awkward answer left Candice's eventual swing vote up in the air. In the end, Yul was declared the Sole Survivor for his brilliant strategy and excellent social game over Ozzy's dominance in challenges in a 5-4-0 jury vote.\n\nAt the Live Reunion Show, Yul lost the fan favorite award to Ozzy.	12	1	1	8	9	3	39	0.31

19	Ozzy Lusth	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ozzy_Lusth	4	Upon arriving at camp, Ozzy thrived and began to show his survival skills at an early start. This earned him in good standing with his fellow tribe mates and allowed him to form a bond with everybody, except Billy Garcia. During the events of Days 4-6, Ozzy began to notice Billy's lack of work ethic and suggested to his tribe that they intentionally lose the next Immunity Challenge to vote Billy out. Despite a mixed reception to the idea, the tribe followed and J.P. Calderon sat out of a challenge that would be more suited to him than Billy, and at Tribal Council Ozzy got his wish and Billy was eliminated.\n\nAfter a tribe reshuffle, Ozzy and Cecilia Mansilla were placed on the Aitutaki tribe. Ozzy was chosen by Yul Kwon. He and Cecilia were outnumbered by former Rarotonga and Puka Puka members. At their first Tribal Council he made an alliance with Cecilia and Sundra Oakley. The alliance thought they had Jessica Smith and Cao Boi Bui on their side at Tribal Council, but Cecilia was voted out when Cao Boi and Jessica flipped to the opposite alliance. Despite being outnumbered, Aitutaki won the next three Immunity Challenge's. During the Double Tribal Council twist on Day 15, Ozzy was spared because of his physical strength and when the majority alliance turned on themselves, Cao Boi was blindsided. Aitutaki lost the next Immunity Challenge and Ozzy was once again spared as Jessica was eliminated for not fitting in with the tribe.\n\nDuring the mutiny on Day 20, former Aitutaki tribe members Candice Woodcock and Jonathan Penner flipped and joined the Rarotonga tribe. After the Mutiny Aituitaki won the next two Immunity Challenge's. During this time, Ozzy successfully maintained strong relationships with Yul Kwon, Sundra Oakley, and Becky Lee - together, these four would form one of the series' most powerful alliances.\n\nOzzy made the merge with a 5-4 numbers advantage. While merged Ozzy became good friends with Nate Gonzalez, who was a former Rarotonga member. Despite coming into the merge with a numbers disadvantage Ozzy won the Immunity Challenge, staying safe at the first Tribal Council. Yul convinced a former Rarotonga member, Jonathan, to flip on his former tribe and join the Aitutaki alliance. At the first post-merge Tribal Council, Nate was blindsided by a 5-4 vote. During the next few episodes Ozzy stayed true to his alliance by voting out Candice, Jonathan, Parvati Shallow, and Adam Gentry in that respective order. He also told the ex-Rarotonga members he did not really care who was eliminated, showing signs of flipping on his alliance, although he never did flip. Ozzy also won 5 of the 6 Immunity Challenges post-merge, losing only one Immunity Challenge to Adam on Day 30. Ozzy's alliance made it to the final four, where Ozzy once again won Immunity. At the Final Four Tribal Council, Ozzy enforced a tiebreaker challenge between Sundra and Becky, with Becky emerging victorious. At the Final Tribal Council, Ozzy was praised for his physical strength, however he only received four jury votes, finishing second to Yul.\n\nAt the live Reunion Show, Ozzy was announced as the fan favorite player of the season, winning himself a new Mercury Mariner.	16	0	2	8	7	3.1	39	0.41
14	Jonathan Penner	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Penner	3	Jonathan was initially placed on the Rarotonga tribe consisting of Caucasian-American castaways. While on the boat during marooning, the Puka Puka tribe's chicken escaped and Jonathan retrieved it for his own tribe. At camp, however, Jessica Smith accidentally set the chicken loose, earning Jonathan's ire. Prior to the first Immunity Challenge, the chicken incident was discussed, with Puka Puka identifying Jonathan as the theft. Rarotonga then finished third to win immunity, while the losing Manihiki tribe sent Jonathan to Exile Island for stealing the chicken; Jonathan returned the next day.\n\nWhen Manihiki and Puka Puka were dissolved on Day 7, the remaining players were switched to either Aitutaki or Rarotonga, with Jonathan being switched to Aitutaki, where he aligned with Becky Lee, Candice Woodcock, and Yul Kwon. However, when Aitutaki lost the subsequent Immunity Challenge, Candice was sent to Exile Island, leaving Jonathan's alliance in the minority, with Becky as the target. However, after strong lobbying from Jonathan and Yul, Jessica and Cao Boi Bui flipped to Jonathan's side, so Cecilia Mansilla was blindsided. Aitutaki then enjoyed a lengthy winning streak. However, on Day 15, host Jeff Probst announced that both tribes would go to a Double Tribal Council. Jonathan and Candice were then targeted by Cao Boi, who wanted the tribe to split the votes between the two of them to potentially flush out the Hidden Immunity Idol as the two had previously been to Exile Island. At Tribal Council, Jonathan and Candice's alliance instead opted to save them, blindsiding Cao Boi instead. When Aitutaki lost the following Immunity Challenge on Day 18, Jessica lobbied for Jonathan's elimination. The others considered voting out Jonathan for his perceived untrustworthiness, but at Tribal Council, Jessica was voted out in a unanimous vote.\n\nThe next morning, Jonathan and Candice plotted for an upcoming merge. At the Reward Challenge, a mutiny offer was presented, where anybody could change tribe affiliations. Candice was the first to accept the offer and a visibly shocked Jonathan followed her at the last second. Both of them rejoined the Rarotonga tribe and became part of the Raro Alliance. Rarotonga then lost the subsequent Immunity Challenge. While Jonathan was a target, Brad Virata openly stating he did not trust anyone resulted in his unanimous elimination. When Rarotonga lost immunity again, Jonathan found himself targeted. At Tribal Council, however, Rebecca Borman was unanimously voted out. Jeff then asked Parvati Shallow to open the bottle which was given to the tribe after they lost immunity. When she opened it and read the note, it was revealed that the tribe had to immediately vote out another member in a Double Elimination. Although Jenny Guzon-Bae and Nate Gonzalez voted against Jonathan, the original Rarotonga bloc of Jonathan, Candice, Parvati, and Adam Gentry stuck together, blindsiding Jenny.\n\nThe next day, the tribes merged into the Aitutonga tribe. Yul talked to Jonathan about rejoining his Aitu Four alliance, but Jonathan was not sure if he would flip back, stating that he would consider flipping back to Yul's side if Yul showed him the Hidden Immunity Idol. At camp, Yul showed Jonathan the idol to sway him back to his side: if Jonathan did not vote with Yul and his allies, they would vote for Jonathan, and Yul's idol would negate the Raro Alliance's votes and send Jonathan home. He later talked to his alliance about the idea of Yul possibly having the idol, but they did not believe it, which gave Jonathan a good reason to flip. Jonathan requested that Yul vote for Nate in exchange for him flipping to their side, which Yul readily agreed to. At Tribal Council, Jonathan blindsided the Raro Alliance and joined the Aitu Four in voting out Nate 5–4.\n\nAfter coming back from Tribal Council, he explained to Candice his decision, while Parvati ridiculed him for flipping. At the Survivor Auction on Day 29, he bought a lot of food and acted in an obnoxious manner, which rubbed the rest of the tribe the wrong way. After the Immunity Challenge, the Raro Alliance pleaded to Yul to vote out Jonathan. While Adam, Candice, and Parvati were taking a "snuggling session" in the shelter, the Aitu Four downed a handful of fish that Jonathan caught. But Candice, seeing this, confronted Jonathan about his arrogance and told him that the whole tribe hated him. In a heated Tribal Council, Adam, Candice, and Parvati chastised Jonathan and pleaded for his elimination. Jonathan received votes from the Raro Alliance, but the Aitu Four sided with him, leaving Candice to be voted out.\n\nThe next day, Jonathan was able to meet with his wife Stacy at the Loved Ones Challenge. Parvati won the challenge and sent Jonathan to Exile Island. After Ozzy Lusth won immunity, Adam and Parvati pleaded the Aitu Four to get Jonathan out, though Yul assured Jonathan that he was on his side. At Tribal Council, however, the Aitu Four sided with Adam and Parvati in unanimously voting Jonathan out. Before leaving Tribal Council, Jonathan told the others that he would like his hat back at some point, which Yul returned at the next Tribal Council.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Jonathan asked Yul how telling half lies kept in line with his integrity, and accused Ozzy of being arrogant and asked him how a million dollars would make his world a better place. He voted for Yul to win, which he did in a close 5-4-0 vote over Ozzy and Becky respectively.	7	0	7	8	9	3.8	33	0.21

16	Yau-Man Chan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Yau-Man_Chan	2	Like everybody in Fiji, Yau-Man was surprised to find that the castaways started the game without tribes. Before the tribes were chosen, Yau-Man impressed everybody with his physical strength and his intelligence, using his physics knowledge to break a crate that the physically stronger castaways could not open. After the tribes were divided on Day 2, Yau-Man was placed on Ravu, which would later become the Have Nots tribe after they lost the initial Immunity Challenge, which relegated their tribe to a desolate beach. Ravu lost almost every subsequent challenge they competed in. Although initially worried that his tribe members would see him as weak, Yau-Man joined Earl Cole in making the Syndicate Alliance. This kept him safe from elimination at Tribal Council. At the tribe switch, Yau-Man was swapped to the Moto tribe with close allies Earl and Michelle Yi. He enjoyed the many luxuries the tribe had in comparison to Ravu. Moto won all the remaining challenges except one Reward Challenge, bringing Yau-Man safely to the merge. He also managed to find the Hidden Immunity Idol at Moto's camp after visiting Exile Island.\n\nAt the merge, Yau-Man rejoined with his alliance and picked off the remaining loyal Four Horsemen members. Yau-Man won a 2008 Ford Super Duty truck at the Day 34 Reward Challenge, though he made a deal with Dreamz Herd as he knew that Dreamz did not have a car of his own. The deal was that if he gave Dreamz the car, Dreamz would had to give Yau-Man the Immunity Necklace at the final four should he win it. Dreamz happily agreed to the deal, thanking Yau-Man. Yau-Man also sent himself to Exile Island. After finding the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol, he shared it with Earl, and together they found another idol, which Earl kept. Although Dreamz accepted Yau-Man's deal, he did not want to commit and noted that the deal only applied at the final four. Using this, Stacy Kimball convinced Boo Bernis and Cassandra Franklin to vote out Yau-Man before the final four. Yau-Man discovered their plan and played his Hidden Immunity Idol at Tribal Council, sending Stacy home instead.\n\nYau managed to win the next Immunity Challenge, keeping him safe to the final four. At the Final Immunity Challenge, it came down to Yau-Man and Dreamz, with the latter winning. At Tribal Council, Dreamz betrayed Yau-Man and kept the Immunity Necklace for himself, saying that if he gave up immunity, he would be voted out instead. This led to Yau-Man being voted out on Day 38, as he was the biggest threat going into the Final Tribal Council.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Yau-Man showed no ill-will toward Dreamz for the betrayal. He simply asked why Earl voted him out. Earl said it was because he knew that Yau-Man would win if he had reached the end. Satisfied, Yau-Man voted for his ally Earl to win the title of Sole Survivor.	10	1	4	8	9	3.3	38	0.26

15	Courtney Yates	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Courtney_Yates	2	Courtney began the game on the Fei Long tribe. Over the course of the first few days, Courtney grew annoyed with Jean-Robert Bellande's laziness, annoying snoring, and overall creepiness towards the women of the tribe. She also formed an unlikely friendship with Leslie Nease, as the two were seen as the physically weakest and most misunderstood members of the tribe. At Fei Long's first Tribal Council on Day 9, Courtney voted with Leslie against Jean-Robert because of their conflict, but Leslie was voted out 6-2 instead due to concerns about her connections to the other tribe.\n\nCourtney remained on Fei Long following the Day 13 Tribe Switch. Soon after, she joined Amanda Kimmel and Todd Herzog's alliance alongside the rest of the original Fei Long members, but stated that she only did so because she disliked Amanda and Todd less than the rest of the group. Courtney also formed a friendship with original Zhan Hu member Sherea Lloyd and lobbied for her to be spared over Jean-Robert when Fei Long lost immunity on Day 18. In spite of her protests however, Sherea was voted out, with Courtney again voting against Jean-Robert. The following day, Courtney was upset with both Todd and Amanda, stating she didn't feel like they were her friends since they weren't yet willing to vote out Jean-Robert but instead the people she had grown closest with.\n\nOn Day 20, the two tribes merged into Hae Da Fung. For the first few votes after the merge, Courtney remained loyal to her alliance, which mainly targeted the original Zhan Hu members. She also won individual immunity on Day 24 as she was able to keep herself relatively still on her barrel, surprising even herself. Courtney's fortunes continued that night, when her long-time rival Jean-Robert was finally voted out, much to her delight. Courtney's commitment to her allies was again tested on Day 27, when she sided with them to vote out her "Survivor boyfriend" Frosti Zernow in a unanimous vote, despite worries that she wouldn't.\n\nAs the numbers dwindled, Courtney remained in lock-step with Todd and Amanda, who were able to blindside James Clement and vote out Erik and Peih Gee, the final two members of the original Zhan Hu tribe. Courtney stated that she believed that it would be most beneficial for all of them to go to the Final Three together as a trio, as they had angered most of the same people on the jury. On Day 38, Amanda once again won immunity, but Courtney found herself in a safe spot as Todd and Denise Martin were gunning for each other, leaving her and Amanda to decide who to send home. Ultimately, the two remained loyal to their Final 3 agreement with Todd, making Denise the final member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Courtney highlighted that she wasn't a lifelong fan of the show and learned to survive on her own in a highly physical game. She also claimed to have found her footing around the merge, specifically referencing her immunity win and that a girl of her stature was still there on Day 39. However, she was largely ignored by the jury, who mainly focused on Todd and Amanda. Although she was appreciated by some as a more honest person than Todd and Amanda and someone who overcame the most odds, she was criticized by several jurors for seemingly taking a back seat strategically and her inability to criticize Todd's game. When the final vote was revealed, Courtney finished second to Todd, receiving the votes of Denise and James.	9	0	2	7	6	1.6	39	0.23
14	Amanda Kimmel	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Amanda_Kimmel	3	Amanda was initially placed on the Fei Long tribe, where she formed an early alliance with Aaron Reisberger, Courtney Yates, and Todd Herzog. During the early days of the game Amanda, like most of the women on the tribe, grew to dislike Jean-Robert Bellande due to his perceived creepiness. After losing their first Immunity Challenge on Day 9, Amanda originally planned on voting for Jean-Robert. However, due to Leslie Nease being kidnapped by Zhan Hu and admitting that she was closer to them than she was to her original tribe, Amanda decided she was too much of a threat to keep, and Leslie was eliminated in a 6-2 vote.\n\nAfter the tribe switch on Day 13, Fei Long lost its two strongest members, Aaron and James Clement, and Amanda lost one of her closest allies. Despite this, they gained original Zhan Hu members Frosti Zernow and Sherea Lloyd. When the new Zhan Hu tribe threw the next Immunity Challenge to vote out a former Fei Long member, Aaron was voted out. Amanda and Todd, who had grown closer since the switch, planned to kidnap James and give him the Hidden Immunity Idol so that he could throw the challenge and vote out a member of the Zhan Hu Alliance. Despite this, Denise Martin was unable to win the challenge for Fei Long, sending them to Tribal Council once again. Despite Courtney's pleas to vote out Jean-Robert, Amanda voted out Sherea as she felt it would be the smartest move going into the merge.\n\nAfter the tribes merged into the Hae Da Fung tribe on Day 20, James rejoined the Fei Long Alliance, and together they voted out Zhan Hu member Jaime Dugan. Amanda considered James to be one of the biggest threats remaining as he had both of the Hidden Immunity Idols and was the biggest physical threat. At the following Reward Challenge, Amanda's team won a trip to a Chinese village and a meal. At the previous Tribal Council, Jean-Robert became aware of the existence of the Hidden Immunity Idol and Amanda had to act surprised in order to not let him know she already knew where both the idols were. Amanda planned on voting out Peih-Gee Law next in order to keep her alliance strong, and became suspicious of Todd when he suggested voting out James and then quickly switching the plan to voting out Jean-Robert. Despite her suspicions, Amanda stuck with her alliance and voted out Jean-Robert next.\n\nOn Day 26, Amanda's team won the Reward Challenge and won an overnight cruise. During the reward, Amanda grew closer to Erik Huffman, stating that she would like to see him stick around as long as possible. At the following Immunity Challenge, the castaways were given the choice to sit out of the challenge and enjoy a feast of burgers and fries or compete in the challenge. Amanda decided that immunity was more important than food so she competed in the challenge, being the only member of her alliance to do so; she, however, lost the challenge to Peih-Gee. At Tribal Council, the vote came down to Erik and Frosti. Amanda eventually decided to vote for Frosti as he was a bigger threat and had grown close to Courtney.\n\nAmanda once again noticed how much of a threat James was becoming as he still possessed both Hidden Immunity Idols. She convinced her alliance that the final seven was the time to vote him out because if they did not do so, then he would be guaranteed a spot in the final four (being able to use his idols at the final six and five) and could easily win from there. She also told Peih-Gee to act as if she was going home, without telling her who the target was, in order to lessen James' suspicion about being blindsided. At Tribal Council, Amanda's plan came to fruition and James was blindsided with both idols in his pocket. The next Reward Challenge was the Loved Ones Challenge and Amanda was extremely excited to see her sister, Katrina. Denise won the challenge and picked Amanda to join her on the reward, so she got to spend a night with her sister. Amanda also came close to winning the following Immunity Challenge, but she lost it to Peih-Gee. Since Peih-Gee had immunity, Amanda and her alliance were forced to vote out the only outsider left, Erik.\n\nAmanda won the next Immunity Challenge and continued growing suspicious of Todd, worried that he would flip on anyone to get ahead and noted how good of a game he was playing. Due to this, she considered Peih-Gee's plan to vote him out. However, at Tribal Council, she deemed Peih-Gee to be the bigger threat and voted her out over Todd. Now having reached the final four, the Fei Long Alliance was forced to turn on itself. On Day 37, Amanda won a very important Reward Challenge and chose to share it with Todd. During the reward, Amanda confessed her suspicions to Todd and told him that she did not trust him. Todd reaffirmed his loyalty to her and promised that they would go to the end together. Despite this, she was still wary of Todd and promised Denise that she would have her back. At the Final Immunity Challenge the following day, Amanda took a unique approach to the challenge, stacking her dishes upside down. This strategy paid off as the challenge eventually came down to Amanda and Denise. Denise attempted to strike a deal with Amanda, though Amanda bluntly turned her down. Amanda's strategy in the challenge and the previous reward paid off as she outlasted Denise and won her second immunity in a row. Amanda was conflicted as she had promised both Denise and Todd that she would not vote for them. At Tribal Council, Denise called Amanda out on her promise, which she quickly denied. Todd smirked at this and stated that it was sly of Amanda to do that, which angered Amanda. Amanda eventually decided to vote out Denise as she believed that Denise could easily win over the jury.\n\nAfter Tribal Council, Amanda was still angry at Todd for his actions at Tribal Council. Todd apologized, yet Amanda did not believe him. At the Final Tribal Council, Amanda admitted how hard it was for her to stay honest with everyone. She answered the jurors' questions poorly and apologized numerous times for the moves she had made. This disastrous performance ended up losing her the game as she finished in third place behind Todd and Courtney, receiving only Erik's vote.	12	0	3	8	9	2.9	39	0.31
12	Peih-Gee Law	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Peih-Gee_Law	2	Peih-Gee, being of Chinese descent, was grateful that she was competing on Survivor in China and believed her recently deceased grandfather would be proud of her. After the conclusion of the welcoming ceremony, the castaways were asked to find the bag with their name on it. Peih-Gee's bag was yellow and she was placed on the Zhan Hu tribe. Peih-Gee felt usually serious when on the show, in contrast to her tribe, and believed that she was on the losing tribe. Zhan Hu did lose the first challenge of the season to the Fei Long tribe was comforted by Dave Cruser after she cried about the loss. Peih-Gee oversaw the construction of the shelter and asked Chicken Morris for his opinion. Chicken kept quiet about his opinion like he did in the past few days, which annoyed Peih-Gee. At Tribal Council, Peih-Gee voted against Chicken for his unwillingness to step up and he was voted out in a 5-2-1 vote.\n\nThe next day, Peih-Gee settled for being the number two to Dave. However, Dave's attitude and leadership irritated the tribe. At the Reward Challenge, Peih-Gee was unable to compete, as Fei Long won the challenge in two rounds. They also kidnapped Jaime Dugan until the next Immunity Challenge. When Zhan Hu returned to their camp, they discovered that it was flooded. Zhan Hu was unable to shake its misfortunes and they lost the Immunity Challenge again on Day 6. At Tribal Council, the tribe elected to vote out Ashley Massaro over Dave in a unanimous vote.\n\nZhan Hu managed to shake their losing streak when the women won the tribe its first challenge for reward and the choice to kidnap someone from Fei Long until the next Immunity Challenge. Zhan Hu chose Leslie Nease to join them. Leslie was impressed by the tribe's positive attitude, despite their losing streak. The women also learned from Leslie some of Fei Long's tribe dynamics while engaging in girl talk. Zhan Hu also managed to win tribal immunity, finally keeping Peih-Gee away from Tribal Council.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhan Hu continued its misfortune when it was discovered that mold was growing in the rice and Zhan Hu lost the next Reward Challenge. As Dave was kidnapped, Zhan Hu had to do the work load he usually did. However, Sherea Lloyd sat in the shelter under the justification that she was saving her energy for the challenges. At the Immunity Challenge, Peih-Gee was partnered with Sherea. While Peih-Gee failed to score, Sherea scored a point for Zhan-Hu. However, Zhan-Hu ended up losing the challenge. At Tribal Council, Peih-Gee joined the tribe in voting out the hard-working, but annoying Dave over the stronger, but lazier Sherea in a unanimous vote.\n\nOn Day 13, Zhan Hu received a note instructing them to select two members of Fei Long who would become members of Zhan Hu. Like her tribemates, Peih-Gee assumed that Zhan Hu would just be gaining two members and Fei Long would be crippled, picking Aaron Reisberger and James Clement. However, Zhan Hu was floored when they received another note revealing that Sherea and Frosti Zernow would be transferred to Fei Long. James was a workhorse, but kept to himself, while Aaron was personable, though Peih-Gee felt that the latter should go first because he was more crafty and more likely to flip back to Fei Long. Peih-Gee talked to Jaime and convinced her to throw the next challenges, not only to eliminate the two biggest athletic threats but to also have even numbers when the tribes merge. The women's plans worked and Zhan Hu successfully threw the Immunity Challenge on Day 15. Peih-Gee and Jaime laughed about how badly they looked at the challenge. However, James was not amused and his attitude made the original Zhan Hus consider axing him instead. But at Tribal Council, the Zhan Hus stuck with their original target, with Aaron being voted out.\n\nPeih-Gee was glad to have voted out Aaron, believing him to be one of the more powerful players in the game and hoped that the tribes would merge after they voted out James. At the next Reward Challenge, Peih-Gee told Sherea that Zhan Hu still had her and Frosti's backs. However, Sherea did not say anything. Zhan Hu lost the Reward Challenge and James was kidnapped by Fei Long. Peih-Gee was troubled by Sherea not acknowledging her and Jaime pointed out that Frosti did not even made eye contact with them and felt that they needed to win immunity. Despite losing her round and James attempting to throw the challenge, Zhan Hu would win the challenge after Denise Martin from Fei Long was unable to eat her balut. \n\nPeih-Gee attempted to sway James by pointing out that when Zhan Hu won immunity, they basically sacrificed one of their allies to protect him, but he was not interested. On Day 20, the tribes would merge and the castaways would move to Fei Long's campsite. The newly merged tribe was treated to a feast and entertainment provided by Chinese performers. Peih-Gee was the one to name the merged tribe Hae Da Fung. Later, the castaways were quizzed on events on the merge feast for immunity, which was won by Frosti. Despite Zhan Hu's attempts to take control of the Game, Jaime was voted out in a 7-3 vote. At the next Reward Challenge, Peih-Gee became a captain and chose Frosti, Courtney Yates, and Erik Huffman to be on her team, though they ended up losing the challenge. While the winning team was on the reward, Peih-Gee attempted to organize Courtney, Denise, Erik, Frosti, and herself into a voting bloc but the Fei Longs were not interested. At the Immunity Challenge, Peih-Gee became the fifth person out of the challenge, with Courtney winning individual immunity. Peih-Gee was upset because she felt she was the next target. At Tribal Council, however, Jean-Robert Bellande was blindsided in a 5-3-1 vote much to Peih-Gee's relief.\n\nAt the next Reward Challenge, Peih-Gee once again became a team captain. Peih-Gee picked James, who picked Todd Herzog, who picked Denise. The group of four was very uncoordinated during the challenge, costing them the win. A frustrated Peih-Gee blamed James openly for the challenge, while he quietly did the same to her. At the next Immunity Challenge, the castaways were given the choice of competing or eating burgers with all the fixings, fries, and drinking sodas. Peih-Gee chose to compete and would win immunity. At Tribal Council, Peih-Gee joined the tribe in voting out Frosti. After Frosti left the Tribal Council area, the castaways were quizzed on facts about China for a trip to Shaolin Temple. Peih-Gee beat out James and Todd for reward and picked ally Erik, as well as Denise, to join her. On the way to the temple, Peih-Gee attempted to form a Final Three alliance with them. At the Immunity Challenge, Peih-Gee failed to score and lost, with Erik winning immunity over Amanda Kimmel. Correctly suspecting that James had the Hidden Immunity Idols, Peih-Gee wanted him to play one and planned with Erik to vote for Todd Herzog. However, James did not use either of his idols and he ended up being blindsided in a 5-1-1 vote. \n\nPeih-Gee was relieved as she felt that James' blindside exposed cracks in the Fei Long Alliance. The next Reward Challenge was the Loved Ones Challenge and Peih-Gee was partnered with her father, Lawrence. The challenge was won by Denise and her husband, who picked Todd, Amanda, and their sisters, to join her on the reward. Peih-Gee was particularly upset, since she picked Denise to join her on a once in a life time experience at the previous reward. The remaining three at camp agreed that Todd's reaction to his other sister's miscarriage was theatrical and pre-planned. Denise talked to Peih-Gee on why she did not pick her. Peih-Gee asked Denise why she picked Amanda and she said that Amanda nearly fainted at Tribal Council. At the Immunity Challenge, Peih-Gee was trailing behind Todd, but was able to win because of Todd missing a question at the end. Peih-Gee attempted to convince Denise to flip and while Denise admitted she was on the bottom, she chose to stick with the Fei Longs, eliminating Erik from the game.\n\nAt the following Reward Challenge, the castaways had to shoot arrows at a board in order to score a point for the person's area that was hit. However, Peih-Gee only received one arrow from Courtney, who she thanked, though she was unable to score. Denise ending up winning the challenge and opted to bring Courtney and Todd with her. Peih-Gee was again disappointed that Denise did not choose her for the trip to the Great Wall of China despite Peih-Gee chosing Denise to join her on the trip to Shaolin Temple. Peih-Gee was also agitated with Denise's "I don't want Peih-Gee getting any stronger" comment. Back at camp, Amanda asked Peih-Gee on why she disliked her. Peih-Gee respected Amanda and for speaking her mind. The women bonded and fared well for themselves, finding fruit and catching fish. When the others returned, Peih-Gee and Amanda were annoyed with Courtney and Todd's complaining about the food. At the Immunity Challenge, Peih-Gee made it to the final round, but lost immunity to Amanda. Amanda and Denise contemplated voting out Todd for being untrustworthy. However, when the vote came, Peih-Gee was unanimously voted out over Todd.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Peih-Gee's first question was for Todd on whether was he a strategist or was just carried to the end. Todd said he was not carried and pointed out that Jean-Robert called him a strategic threat and was correct. Todd also pointed out that he got the numbers by getting Amanda, Courtney, and Denise to pick off the Zhan Hus, then followed by a head-to-head battle with each other, and that he fought until the end. Peih-Gee turned her attention to Amanda, annoyed with how Amanda had presented herself at the Final Tribal Council. Peih-Gee wanted to know something that Amanda did better than Todd. Amanda said that her strategy was to be surrounded by people who she competes with in challenges and said that she suggested that they vote out James because of his athleticism and idols. Peih-Gee voted for Todd to become the Sole Survivor, which he did in a 4-2-1 vote.  	6	0	5	7	8	3.3	36	0.17
10	James Clement	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/James_Clement	3	After the welcoming ceremony at a Buddhist temple, James was placed on the Fei Long tribe. James immediately proved to be a hard worker for his tribe. However, after a conversation with Leslie Nease, James revealed in a confessional that his biggest obstacle was the social aspect as he prefers to be by himself. Fei Long proved to be the more dominant tribe in challenges, developing a winning streak over their rival Zhan Hu tribe over the first six days.\n\nThe tribe lost their first challenge, a Reward Challenge, on Day 7. Zhan Hu was able to kidnap Fei Long's Leslie Nease as part of their reward, and James and Jean-Robert Bellande talked loudly back at camp about who to vote out next in an insulting manner before settling on Leslie. The men failed to notice that Courtney Yates and Todd Herzog were only a few yards and were annoyed with them and wanted them out. Fei Long lost its first Immunity Challenge on Day 9, and at Tribal Council, Leslie was voted out over Jean-Robert. The tribe was then able to bounce back, winning the next two challenges.\n\nOn Day 13, two Chinese men came with a note asking Fei Long to pick Zhan Hu's two strongest members, who would then become members of Fei Long. The tribe speculated that the note meant that two Fei Long members were being transferred to Zhan Hu as well; Fei Long eventually chose Frosti Zernow and Sherea Lloyd to transfer from Zhan Hu. Jean-Robert warned James that if Zhan Hu received the same note, then James would be going Zhan Hu. Sure enough, two different fishermen came with a note revealing that James and Aaron Reisberger would be transferred to the Zhan Hu, joining the majority Zhan Hu Alliance alliance of Erik Huffman, Jaime Dugan, and Peih-Gee Law. At the first Immunity Challenge following the switch, James became frustrated with Jaime and Peih-Gee when he noticed that the women were botching the puzzle while cracking jokes. Zhan Hu ended up losing the challenge after the women threw it in order to vote out either of their two new members. At Tribal Council, James became incredulous when he learned that the women threw the challenge. However, James was spared as the Zhan Hu Alliance decided to eliminate Aaron instead.\n\nNow alone and on the bottom of his new tribe, James felt that the best thing for him to do was to do the work at camp to keep Zhan Hu rested so that they would have no excuse for losing the next challenge. Despite this Zhan Hu was still set on throwing the challenge and voting out James. Zhan Hu lost the next Reward Challenge on Day 17, but James was chosen to be kidnapped by Fei Long, joining his old tribemates on a trip to a Chinese tea house. While at the reward, Todd Herzog told James to share the container with him once James had opened it. When he did open it, James learned that it was a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol. James gave the clue to Todd, who later returned with the idol and gave it to James. Todd asked James to throw the next Immunity Challenge so James could use the idol to vote out Jaime. James felt that it would not be too hard as Zhan Hu was going to throw the challenge anyway. Unbeknownst to James, the Zhan Hu Alliance had figured out this exact plan and resolved to compete to win. Despite James' best efforts at throwing the challenge, Zhan Hu won when Denise Martin was unable to eat a balut, costing Fei Long the challenge.\n\nBack at camp, Peih-Gee tried to convince James to join them after the merge, pointing out that they sacrificed one of their allies to save him, but James was not interested. Based on where Todd told him where the idol was, James went to retrieve the other idol at Zhan Hu's camp. James pulled both plaques down and rushed to place the idol in his bag. He later noticed that the blank plaque was gone and wondered in delight if Jaime had taken it thinking it was a Hidden Immunity Idol. On Day 20, the tribes merged into the Hae Da Fung tribe and enjoyed a feast with entertainment provided by Chinese performers. At Tribal Council, James' suspicions were confirmed when Jaime attempted to play her idol, only for it to be revealed to be fake and she was voted out in a 7-3 vote.\n\nJames felt that he was in a good position because his Fei Long Alliance got along despite the differences. However, Todd and Amanda Kimmel began targeting James because of him having both idols, as well as being a physical threat. At the Reward Challenge, Jean-Robert picked James, Amanda, and Todd, and they won a trip to a 1000-year-old village. Over the next few days, James clashed with Jean-Robert twice, first when it to James eating more rice and second was when the latter interrogated the former about the idols. Jean-Robert then began targeting James after discovering that he was in possession of both idols. At Tribal Council, however, James was spared and Jean-Robert was voted out in a 5-3-1 vote.\n\nJames was shaken by nearly getting voted out. Denise also came to James about being left out of the Jean-Robert blindside because she felt like she was on the outside. James' team lost the next Reward Challenge on Day 26, and James and Peih-Gee argued about the reason for their team's lost. When Peih-Gee won the next Immunity Challenge, however, the Fei Long Alliance chose to target Frosti, sending him to the jury.\n\nOver the next few days, Erik tried to convince James to form a final four alliance with him, Denise, and Peih-Gee. James was not interested, feeling secure in his Fei Long Alliance and likened flipping to eating the apple in the Garden of Eden. However, Amanda deemed James the biggest threat and felt that this was the best chance to blindside him if he did not win immunity. At the Immunity Challenge, James made it to the final round but failed to score, with Erik winning immunity much to the relief of Amanda, Courtney, and Todd. Although James was set voting out Peih-Gee, he was blindsided by his own allies at Tribal Council; James did not use either of his idols and was eliminated in a 5-1-1 vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, James congratulated the finalists and told them that he was not upset with them for blindsiding him. James asked Courtney about one good time on Survivor. Courtney answered the first challenge of the season because she claimed that the pole was heavy and that she was excited when they won because she was not going to be the first person voted out of the season. When asked by host Jeff Probst why he asked that question, James claimed it because he wanted to give the finalists an easy one. In the end, James voted for Courtney to win, who lost to Todd in a 4-2-1 vote, placing second.	7	1	7	4	6	2.8	30	0.23

20	Parvati Shallow	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Parvati_Shallow	4	Fully embracing her flirtatious skills, Parvati further weaponized her feminine charm. Initially, she formed the Malakal Couples Alliance; a Final Three deal with Amanda Kimmel and Cirie Fields; and, later, the Black Widow Brigade, which was best known for orchestrating a long streak of successful blindside votes and eliminating all of the men. Cited as the leader of the Black Widow Brigade, Parvati was crowned as Sole Survivor; however, she received harsh criticism from the men she led voting out, notably James Clement and fellow Cook Islands castmate Ozzy Lusth.	11	1	1	9	9	2.3	39	0.28
19	Amanda Kimmel	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Amanda_Kimmel	3	Amanda returned as one of the ten favorites who would compete against a tribe of die-hard Survivor fans. Amanda quickly formed an alliance with Ozzy Lusth, telling him that he is her favorite player of all time which sparked their relationship. When James Clement and Parvati Shallow sparked their own relationship, they rallied in Amanda and Ozzy to make an alliance, and they soon recruited Jon Dalton as a fifth member. Losing the first Immunity Challenge, Malakal was sent to Tribal Council first, where Jon shocked everyone by requesting that they vote him out so that he could be with his expectant girlfriend. In return, Amanda and the rest of the Favorites unanimously sent the villain home.\n\nAmanda's "couples alliance" became a looming force, concerning Cirie Fields and Jonathan Penner, who awoke in the middle of the night catching Amanda and Ozzy having a steamy moment. Jonathan offered Cirie a place in an alliance with Ami Cusack, Eliza Orlins, and Yau-Man Chan. Any strategies were put on hold, however, as Malakal secured victory in the second Immunity Challenge.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to swing Eliza to the alliance of couples, Amanda and Parvati took Cirie on a fishing trip, where the two proposed about going to the end as the final three, but only if she joined the couples alliance. They assured Cirie that they would be unable to beat either James or Ozzy in the endgame, making the plan mutually beneficial. Cirie agreed, but they would have to help her eliminate her biggest threat, Yau-Man. After Malakal lost the third Immunity Challenge, Amanda's alliance followed Cirie's lead, sending Yau-Man home over their initial target Eliza.\n\nAmanda would be safe for the next cycle, as Malakal won the fourth Immunity Challenge. Amanda's ally Ozzy revealed that he successfully obtained the Hidden Immunity Idol, bringing forth a higher degree of power to the alliance. However, the celebration was short-lived, as the alliance was split in half during a tribe switch, which sent James and Parvati to the rival Airai tribe, while Amanda and Ozzy stayed as Malakal members.\n\nAfter losing the fifth Immunity Challenge, Cirie told Amanda that one of the newcomers, the massive Joel Anderson, would be a bigger physical threat if he were allowed deeper into the game. Convinced, Amanda, the remaining Favorites, and Chet Welch and Tracy Hughes-Wolf, who were outsiders from the original Airai tribe from the beginning, eliminated a visibly stunned Joel. By voting out their strongest member, Malakal suffered a lengthy losing streak, losing all subsequent Immunity Challenges. Amanda and the original Malakal members banded together and eliminated Chet and Tracy for weakness and threat status respectively. The last Fan in Malakal, Erik Reichenbach, revealed that Ami was secretly plotting with the Fans and against the Favorites. Though she tried to explain her side of the story, Ami's treachery was ultimately caught, and she was disposed of. With Ami's elimination, Malakal was reduced to four.\n\nWhen the tribes merged on Day 22, the couples alliance regrouped, but Parvati shocked Amanda that the former would include her in plot to disband the couples alliance and potentially dominate the game under a new alliance—the "Black Widow Brigade," consisting of Amanda, Cirie, Parvati, and Alexis Jones and Natalie Bolton, the two Fans whom Parvati swore Amanda's name with. Initially chagrining over Parvati's plotting using her name without consent, and a growing dislike of Alexis (who was becoming increasingly chummy with Ozzy), Amanda eventually went with the plan. At Dabu's first Tribal Council, Eliza fatally used a fake Hidden Immunity Idol she received from fellow non-allied Jason Siska, and she outright theorized that Ozzy must have planted it after he found the real one during his time on Exile Island, in which Ozzy confessed he did have it. With no allies, Eliza, the only woman that was outside of the brewing all-girl alliance, was voted out, becoming the first member of the jury. After the next Reward Challenge, Amanda would join Erik, Jason, and Ozzy to a trip to the island of Yap for a feast.\n\nAt the next Immunity Challenge, which required endurance, Jason and Parvati were the last two standing. But being an obvious odd man out, Jason tried to increase his odds by telling Parvati that he would step down and give her immunity, but she and everyone must promise not to vote him out. Eventually, everyone including Parvati half-heartedly agreed, winning herself immunity. Amanda and the other girls crossed their fingers, half-giggling while James and Ozzy were bewildered as well. Back at camp, Amanda, Erik, James, and Ozzy talked about reneging their promise; while unbeknownst to them, Cirie and Parvati were starting to put the all-women alliance in motion by working through the former's deal with Jason, using the promise as a platform for Ozzy's elimination and to flush out the idol in the process. Knowing Amanda's loyalty to Ozzy, she was left out of the plot. Still oblivious to the plan, Amanda cast her vote for Jason, thinking that he would go home but was shocked when it was Ozzy who was sent home with the idol in his back pocket.\n\nAfter the vote, Amanda and James consoled each other for being left out in the open. But unlike James, who quietly accepted the predicament, a furious Amanda went to Cirie and Parvati to ask them why she was not informed of the plan beforehand, but the two assured her that the all-girl alliance (and their secret final three deal) was still intact. During a Survivor Auction, Amanda won herself a serving of milk and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, while her ally, Natalie, strategically sent Jason to Exile Island after host Jeff Probst revealed the existence of a second Hidden Immunity Idol. While Jason indeed found the idol, the girls at the Dabu camp started plotting against Jason by making Natalie tell Jason he was safe so he would opt not to use the idol. The plan worked with Jason confidently not using his idol, but he found himself blindsided instead.\n\nAt the next Reward Challenge, Alexis won and chose to send Amanda to Exile Island after the latter had asked to be sent there. She found all the clues and the final clue told her that another Hidden Immunity Idol was buried back at camp, under the tribe flag. After James's medical evacuation on Day 31, Erik was the last man and alliance outsider standing. But to the girls' dismay, Erik won the next Immunity Challenge, forcing the women to turn on each other. Before Tribal Council, Amanda showed her bag, stating that she did not have the idol. Later, she begged Cirie to not vote for her, with Cirie stating that she would not take the risk of drawing rocks. Amanda approached Erik next, telling that Erik has yet to return the favor when he was kept over Ami but was again fruitless. Amanda's last hope, Parvati, agreed to help, by keeping the others from going to the beach where Amanda was digging for the idol, under the premise that Amanda was having a bathroom break. At Tribal Council, the tribe agreed that Amanda was the biggest threat in terms of likability, with Parvati openly stating that she would vote with Amanda. Surprisingly, Amanda fooled everyone by pulling the Hidden Immunity Idol, effectively canceling all votes against her. Amanda excitingly said that she did not have the idol then since the idol was back at camp, so she did not lie, much to the delight of the jury members. With only two votes against her, Alexis was eliminated.\n\nAmanda, Cirie, and Parvati reaffirmed their final three deal by agreeing to eliminate the remaining Fans, Erik and Natalie. They manipulated Erik (who won the Reward Challenge) by sending Parvati to Exile Island so neither of the fans would not have the chance to find the last Hidden Immunity Idol. Erik chose Amanda to join at the reward, to pay back his debt. Later, Erik won the next Immunity Challenge, forcing the women to eliminate one of their own again. As a solution, Cirie told Natalie to convince Erik to give up his necklace to her, and in return, she and Cirie would help him vote Amanda out. At Tribal Council, Amanda taunted Erik by fictitiously castigating him for his deception, which was followed by Natalie and Parvati, forcing him to give his Immunity Necklace to Natalie in hopes of redemption. The plan worked, and Erik was voted out. While she was a part of the Black Widow Brigade, Natalie, the last Fan standing, soon followed.\n\nAmanda, Cirie, and Parvati all celebrated, believing that they were in the Final Three and even decided to release their last chicken Gloria as a form of celebration, but they were soon devastated that only two of them would be in contention to be the Sole Survivor, and another Immunity Challenge would commence. Amanda won the Final Immunity Challenge, making history as the first to make it to Day 39 twice. She then had to make what she thought was the "most difficult decision of her life." At Tribal Council, a sobbing Amanda admitted that her decision was very hard, as there were reasons to take either Cirie or Parvati. Ultimately, she sent Cirie to the jury, bringing Parvati with her to the Final Two as she thought she would not have a chance at winning against Cirie.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Amanda was castigated by the female jurors for being seemingly melodramatic during the previous Tribal Councils, while the men blasted Parvati for her numerous deceptions. While Ozzy was mostly furious with Parvati's betrayal, he admitted that he was most angry for the fact that he could have spent more time with Amanda, and expressed his love for her. Amanda unfortunately ended up answering the jury's questions more poorly compared to Parvati.\n\nThree of the male jurors voted for Amanda, but it was Parvati who took the title of Sole Survivor by securing all four women and Jason's jury votes, thus landing Amanda in the runner-up position once again.	8	1	2	8	9	2.4	39	0.21

18	Cirie Fields	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Cirie_Fields	4	Due to her popularity and having impressive credentials under her name, Cirie returned to Survivor: Micronesia, being initially placed on the "Favorites" Malakal tribe. After the tribe unanimously voted out Jon Dalton at the first Tribal Council, the real dilemma came when Malakal lost again on Day 8, with Cirie being caught in between two opposing alliances. Cirie opted to work with the Malakal Couples Alliance — consisting of Amanda Kimmel, James Clement, Ozzy Lusth, and Parvati Shallow — over Jonathan Penner's alliance — consisting of himself, Ami Cusack, Eliza Orlins, and Yau-Man Chan — since she felt she could persuade the couples more easily. However, James did not like how Cirie wanted to shift the target from Eliza to Yau-Man since she was afraid Yau-Man could find a Hidden Immunity Idol. Despite this, they went along with Cirie's plan and Yau-Man was voted out.\n\nDuring the Tribe Switch on Day 13, Cirie remained on the Malakal tribe with allies Amanda and Ozzy, as well as Ami. The tribe lost every subsequent Immunity Challenge. On Day 14, Cirie overheard Erik Reichenbach and Joel Anderson talking to the other Favorites about targeting the tribe's weakest players, Chet Welch, Tracy Hughes-Wolf, and Cirie herself. Concerned by this, Cirie rallied together the Favorites, as well as Chet and Tracy, to vote out the biggest proponent of keeping the tribe strong, Joel. From that point, the Favorites would take out the Fans, with Chet and Tracy going in the next two Tribal Councils. Then they found out that Ami tried to work with the Fans to take Ozzy out. This prompted Cirie to vote Ami out, sparing Erik and entering the merge with her original alliance intact.\n\nAfter the tribes merged into the Dabu tribe on Day 22 and dispatched of common enemy Eliza, Cirie incorporated Parvati's new allies from Airai: Alexis Jones and Natalie Bolton, into the action with a plan to vote out Ozzy. Despite her friendship with him, she felt this was the only clear opportunity they had to take out the game's biggest threat, who also had the Hidden Immunity Idol. With Jason Siska's doom seeming imminent, Ozzy would never see it coming. That proved to be the case as the girls, as well as Jason, blindsided Ozzy at the next Tribal Council. This would be the beginning of the Black Widow Brigade, an all-female alliance that took out the remaining men.\n\nErik, the last man standing, however, won the next Immunity Challenge, forcing the girls to turn on each other on Day 33. Former Fans Alexis, Erik, and Natalie temporarily realigned to vote out the likable and athletic Amanda. Amanda hoped to count on Cirie and Parvati's votes, but having been in a tiebreaker in her first season, Cirie was unwilling to force another tie, especially since a rock draw would put herself in danger. Cirie voted against Amanda at Tribal Council, but Amanda played her own idol to negate the votes cast against her and blindside Alexis. On Day 36, Erik won immunity once again, but Cirie came up with a plan to convince Erik to give the Immunity Necklace to Natalie to vote out Amanda. Cirie made Erik believe that his word was no longer good and that giving the Immunity Necklace was the only way to redeem himself. The plan worked, and Erik fell into the trap as the women blindsided him.\n\nOn Day 37, Amanda, Cirie, and Parvati held true to their alliance and voted out Natalie, but they were heartbroken by the news that only two players would make it to the end. Cirie and Amanda had a showdown in the Final Immunity Challenge, with Amanda coming out on top. Cirie was worried because Amanda and Parvati were essentially best friends. Amanda was also concerned that Cirie would be very difficult to beat in the Final Two. At Tribal Council, Amanda voted out Cirie, with Cirie lamenting how close she came but not quite making it.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Cirie cast her vote for Parvati to win over Amanda, respecting her strong gameplay and flawlessly building strong alliances, which she did in a 5-3 vote.	5	0	3	8	9	3.7	38	0.13
16	Erik Reichenbach	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Erik_Reichenbach	2	Erik was placed on the Airai tribe consisting of "diehard" Survivor fans. Erik quickly proved himself to his favorite Survivor player Ozzy Lusth during the first individual Immunity Challenge when he beat Ozzy to the beach. Although Erik was in a comfortable position on his tribe, on Day 6, Joel Anderson wanted to blindside Mary Sartain because of how close she and Mikey Bortone were and how controlling Mikey B. was trying to be. At Tribal Council, Erik sided with Tracy Hughes-Wolf's Older Airai Alliance and joined Joel's plan in blindsiding Mary. At Airai's next Tribal Council on Day 11, Erik joined the majority of the tribe in blindsiding Mikey over the weaker Chet Welch.\n\nWhen the tribe switch occurred on Day 12, Erik along with Tracy, Chet, and Joel were moved to Malakal where he bonded with Ozzy. When Malakal lost the Day 14 Immunity Challenge, Erik joined Joel in voting out Chet for being a burden in challenges, though Cirie Fields gathered the numbers and blindsided Joel for being a strategic threat. Despite being in the minority of the Fans vs. Favorites lines on Malakal, Erik was spared for his challenge strength and he joined the Favorites in voting out Chet and Tracy at Malakal's next two Tribal Councils. While it seemed like Erik would be the next to go after Malakal lost immunity again on Day 21, Erik told Amanda Kimmel, Cirie, and Ozzy that Ami Cusack had been scheming with Tracy's alliance to get Ozzy out ever since Joel's elimination. At Tribal Council, Erik successfully convinced the Favorites in voting out Ami for being untrustworthy.\n\nOn Day 22, the tribes merged with Erik coming up with the tribe's name as Dabu where he joined Ozzy as a member of the Malakal Couples Alliance. At Tribal Council, Erik joined the rest of the tribe minus Jason Siska in voting off the tribe's outcast Eliza Orlins. At the next Tribal Council, Erik stuck with Ozzy in voting for Jason for being Eliza's only ally, but the women of a new alliance led by Parvati Shallow named the Black Widow Brigade minus Amanda took the opportunity to narrowly blindside Ozzy with a Hidden Immunity Idol in his possession. Erik won the next Immunity Challenge on Day 30. At Tribal Council, Erik joined the women in blindsiding Jason with the rehidden idol in his possession, but was unaware that this was part of the women's plan to annihilate the men. After James Clement was medically evacuated the next day, Erik was in danger as the women targeted him for being the last man standing. But Erik managed to thwart their plan when he won the Day 33 Immunity Challenge, forcing the women to turn on each other. At Tribal Council, Erik joined the majority in voting Amanda, but she played the idol that was rehidden after Jason's elimination, negating four votes against her, and Alexis Jones was blindsided for being a potential social threat.\n\nErik won the next Immunity Challenge, thwarting the women's plan once again. However, Cirie suggested that Natalie Bolton attempt to try to convince Erik to give the Immunity Necklace to her, arguing that it would redeem himself in front of the jury and that Cirie and Natalie would agree to vote out Amanda only if Erik saved Natalie. At Tribal Council, Erik fell for the women's ruse when he gave the Immunity Necklace to Natalie and was ultimately blindsided, with James on the jury jokingly saying that he lost his reign as dumbest Survivor player ever.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Erik respected Amanda over Parvati, but questioned the former for throwing him under the bus at his last two Tribal Councils, even calling her out for trying to apologize after it was too little, too late. Despite that, Erik voted Amanda to be the Sole Survivor, but she lost to Parvati in a close 5-3 vote.	8	0	5	7	6	3	36	0.22
14	James Clement	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/James_Clement	3	James returned as one of the ten favorites who would compete against a tribe of die-hard Survivor fans. James quickly sparked a relationship with Parvati Shallow. They rallied in another couple, Ozzy Lusth and Amanda Kimmel, to form an alliance, and soon recruited Jon Dalton as a fifth member. Losing the first Immunity Challenge, Malakal was sent to Tribal Council first, where Dalton shocked everyone by requesting that they vote him out so that he could be with his expectant girlfriend. In return, James and the rest of the Favorites unanimously sent the villain home.\n\nJames' couples alliance faced opposition from an alliance consisting of Yau-Man Chan, Ami Cusack, Eliza Orlins, and Jonathan Penner. The two factions tried to secure the trust of Cirie Fields. Any strategies were put on hold, however, as the tribe of Favorites secured victory in the second Immunity Challenge.\n\nAfter losing the third Immunity Challenge, Cirie agreed to join the couples alliance if they helped her eliminate her biggest threat, Yau-Man. At Tribal Council, James's alliance followed Cirie's lead, sending Yau-Man home. James and Ozzy immediately regretted voting off Yau-Man instead of Eliza, who started to get sick.\n\nJames would be safe for the next cycle, as Malakal won the fourth Immunity Challenge. Ozzy revealed that he had successfully obtained the Hidden Immunity Idol, bringing forth a higher degree of power to the alliance. However, the celebration was short-lived, as the alliance was split in half during a tribe switch, which sent James and Parvati to the rival Airai tribe, while Amanda and Ozzy stayed as Malakal members.\n\nThe new Airai tribe managed to win all of the Immunity Challenges leading up to the merge, only losing Jonathan Penner and Kathy Sleckman. Penner was medically evacuated over a severely infected wound, and Sleckman quit due to depression and boredom.\n\nWhen the tribes merged on Day 22, the couples alliance regrouped, but Parvati had plans to form an entirely new alliance consisting of herself, Amanda, Cirie, and Fans Alexis Jones and Natalie Bolton–the "Black Widow Brigade". At the first Dabu Tribal Council, James voted with the majority to eliminate Eliza Orlins, who was on the outs.\n\nWith nine remaining, Jason Siska was assumed to be the next to go. However, the Black Widow Brigade (minus Amanda) and Jason blindsided physical threat Ozzy, who left with an idol in his possession.\n\nFollowing Ozzy's elimination, the Black Widow Brigade decided it was best to split the vote between Jason, who was in possession of a Hidden Immunity Idol, and James, just in case Jason played the idol. At Tribal Council, James cast his vote towards Parvati, disappointed with her betraying the couples alliance. Jason ultimately did not play his idol and was sent to Ponderosa.\n\nOn Day 31, James was examined by the medical team for a cut finger which had become infected. On the grounds that the infection could spread and cause severe damage to his joints, James was pulled from the game, placing in 7th and as the 4th jury member.\n\nAs a juror, James cast his vote for Amanda to win the game, who lost to Parvati in a 5–3 vote.	10	0	7	8	9	1.5	31	0.32
10	Ami Cusack	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ami_Cusack	2	Ami returned to Survivor: Micronesia as a Favorite in the Malakal tribe, which enjoyed early success in camp life. In the next few days, Ami had formed an alliance with fellow Vanuatu returnee Eliza Orlins, Jonathan Penner, and Yau-Man Chan to usurp the budding Malakal Couples Alliance consisting of Amanda Kimmel, James Clement, Ozzy Lusth, and Parvati Shallow. Malakal lost the Day 3 Immunity Challenge, sending them to Tribal Council. Jon Dalton, aka Jonny Fairplay, asked to be voted out to be with his expectant girlfriend and his request was honored by the entire tribe, sending Fairplay home in a unanimous 9-1 vote. After this, the remaining swing vote was Cirie Fields. Penner and the rest of the alliance, including Ami, believed that Cirie was on their side, but Cirie felt she could trust the Couples Alliance better due to Penner's past as a liar, and joined their ship. Any strategizing was put on hold due to Malakal winning the Day 6 Immunity Challenge. After Malakal won the Day 7 Reward Challenge, Ami volunteered to go to Exile Island, along with fan Kathy Sleckman. Ami immediately wanted to search for the Hidden Immunity Idol, but Kathy convinced Ami that there was a storm coming and they shouldn't be out searching for the idol. Ami reluctantly agreed. Ami returned for the Day 8 Immunity Challenge, but unfortunately, Malakal lost, putting Ami, Eliza, Penner, and Yau-Man on the chopping block. Though the Couples Alliance (except Cirie) were leaning towards voting out perceived weak link Eliza, Cirie convinced the Couples Alliance to vote out strategic threat Yau-Man. At Tribal Council, Yau-Man was voted off, but Ami threw a vote at Cirie for her "betrayal". Though the alliance was upset at the prospect of losing Yau-Man, Malakal was able to win the Day 11 Immunity Challenge.\n\nOn Day 12, a Tribe Switch occurred, saving Ami from being stuck in the minority. Ami was picked by fan Erik Reichenbach to join the new Malakal. The new Malakal consisted of Ozzy, Joel Anderson, Amanda, Erik, Ami, Tracy Hughes-Wolf, Cirie, and Chet Welch. Unfortunately, the new Malakal generally lost in many challenges, though this gave new light to Ami, as Ozzy, Amanda, and Cirie convinced her to align with them to vote out fans Joel, Erik, Tracy, and Chet. Ami joined the new Couples Alliance and stayed in a very secure position. However, when Malakal lost the Day 20 Immunity Challenge, while the initial target was Tracy, Amanda, and Cirie wanted to vote out Erik over Tracy, and the remaining fans wanted to vote out Ozzy. Ami hatched a plan: Ami would tell Ozzy that she'd vote Tracy, she'd convince Cirie and Amanda to vote Erik with her, but in reality, Ami would blindside Ozzy along with the remaining fans, Tracy, and Erik. Though the plan was brilliant, in the end, Ami stayed loyal to the favorites and voted out Tracy over Ozzy. Malakal lost the final Tribal Immunity Challenge on Day 21, due to Airai exiling Ozzy, whose strength was needed in challenges. The last fan on Malakal, Erik, knew he was on the chopping block. However, Erik decided to turn the tables on Ami, revealing to Amanda and Cirie that Ami was planning on betraying Ozzy. This didn't change Amanda and Cirie's minds, forcing Erik to convince kingpin Ozzy to vote out Ami after betraying the favorites. Ozzy agreed with Erik, and tried to convince his alliance to vote out Ami. At Tribal Council, Ozzy pointed out Ami's crafty work, but Ami, who was very emotional, desperately denied this, saying that the favorites should stick together during the merge and that she was an excellent ally. Despite all her reasons why she should stay in the game, Ozzy felt he couldn't trust Ami any longer, and she was voted out in a unanimous 4-1 vote.	5	0	11	7	8	1.6	21	0.24

12	Ozzy Lusth	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ozzy_Lusth	4	Ozzy arrived in Micronesia with mixed reactions from both the Fans and Favorites. Everyone liked him for his talents that he displayed on his original season, but were cautious because of how likely he was to win if he made it far. Ozzy made a strong alliance with Amanda Kimmel, and they joined forces with the other couple in the Malakal tribe, Parvati and James, to form the Malakal Couples Alliance. They quickly realized they only had four members in a tribe of ten people. The alliance tried to convince the two swing votes Jon Dalton and Cirie Fields to join them as opposed to the other alliance which made up the Malakal tribe. After Malakal lost the first Immunity Challenge, Jonny Fairplay asked the tribe to vote him out since he was missing his expectant girlfriend. The tribe granted his wish and Jonny Fairplay was unanimously voted out. The alliance obtained the majority by getting Cirie Fields to side with them. The alliance managed to vote out Yau-Man Chan who was the member of the opposite alliance Cirie was most concerned about at the third Tribal Council. However, Ozzy and James immediately regretted voting Yau-Man off instead of Eliza Orlins since she started to get sick.\n\nOn Day 13, a tribe switch occurred. Ozzy stayed on Malakal with alliance members Amanda and Cirie and opposing alliance member Ami Cusack and they were joined by Chet Welch, Erik Reichenbach, Joel Anderson, and Tracy Hughes-Wolf. Ozzy lead his alliance of himself, Cirie, and Amanda to the merge by eliminating Joel, Chet, Tracey, and Ami at the following Tribal Councils. He decided to keep Erik over Ami since he thought he was the more trustworthy of the two players. Ozzy found a Hidden Immunity Idol after being sent to Exile Island, and made a fake Hidden Immunity Idol to cover his tracks, which Jason Siska found, believing it was the real idol. At the first Individual Immunity Challenge Ozzy put up a tough fight but eventually ended up losing to Jason. Ozzy voted out Eliza at Tribal Council because she was the last remaining outsider not immune. At the next Immunity Challenge Jason, the last outsider, agreed to a deal with Parvati to step down for food for the tribe as long as her alliance didn't vote him out. Everyone halfheartedly agreed not to vote for him. The core alliance members of Amanda, Ozzy, James, and alliance affiliate Erik decided to renege the promise. But Cirie saw this as the perfect time to blindside Ozzy due to him being a physical threat and having the Hidden Immunity Idol. All the remaining women voted against Ozzy except Amanda, supplemented by Jason's vote, which resulted him being blindsided.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Ozzy's vote appeared to be the most obvious of the night as he heavily criticized Parvati and reiterated his feelings for Amanda. He voted for Amanda, who lost to Parvati by a vote of 5-3.	6	1	9	6	8	3.1	27	0.22

11	Eliza Orlins	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Eliza_Orlins	2	After her memorable appearance in Vanuatu, Eliza returned for Survivor: Micronesia. Eliza began the game on the Malakal tribe, along with nine other fan-favorites. Early on, Eliza noticed the alliance of Parvati Shallow, James Clement, Amanda Kimmel, and Ozzy Lusth, which preempted her into forming an alliance with Yau-Man Chan, Jonathan Penner, and Ami Cusack against the "Couples". This act made her seem as a threat by Parvati's alliance, who conspired to vote her out during their first Tribal Council. However, this plan was put on hold when Jon Dalton asked the entire tribe to vote him out first in order to be with his expectant girlfriend.\n\nWhen Eliza's alliance failed to convince Cirie Fields to join them, they found themselves as the minority, as Parvati's alliance (with whom Cirie sided) voted for Yau-Man due to his experiences with the Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nDuring the tribe switch, Eliza's alliance was split, as she and Jonathan were switched to Airai, while Ami stayed on Malakal. However, she quickly lost her ally Jonathan when he was injured during a challenge and had to be evacuated. During this time, Eliza befriended and aligned with Jason Siska, who, like herself, felt on the outs with his original tribe.\n\nFollowing the merge, Eliza felt disheartened by Ami's elimination, as she had planned to bring Jason and Ami to the Final Three. Jason surprised Eliza, however, when he told her that he found the Hidden Immunity Idol. He promised that, should he win individual immunity, he would give his idol to Eliza. This was actually a fake idol that Ozzy had planted after finding the real idol on Exile Island, although Jason was certain it was real. When Jason won individual immunity, he gave the "idol" to Eliza, who immediately knew it was a fake, infamously asserting, "It's a f***ing stick", to his disbelief. She decided to play it anyway in the hopes of exposing that Ozzy had the real one, to which Ozzy admitted he did. Eliza was voted out 8-2 and became the first member of the jury. When Ozzy was blindsided at the following Tribal Council with his idol in his pocket, Eliza had a famously theatrical reaction, nearly bursting into laughter from the jury bench.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Eliza complimented finalists Parvati and Amanda on their strategic gameplay but criticized Parvati for being mean and Amanda for being superficial. Despite disliking her more, Eliza gave her jury vote to Parvati who won in a 5-3 vote.	10	0	10	7	6	2.4	24	0.42
1	Jon Dalton	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Dalton	2	Jon returned as part of Malakal, the tribe of returning players who would compete against Airai, the tribe of die-hard Survivor fans. At the first individual Immunity Challenge on Day 1, where tribes were to retrieve an individual Immunity Idol (which would protect its wielder the first time their tribe goes to Tribal Council), Jon found the other tribe's idol, which was tied at the bow of a boat. Realizing his mistake, he rushed to the other boat, only to be accidentally tackled by fellow favorite Yau-Man Chan, to his anger. During his three-day stay, Jon's support was sought by two conflicting alliances: a budding "couples" alliance consisted of Parvati Shallow, James Clement, Ozzy Lusth, and Amanda Kimmel; and another foursome consisted of Ami Cusack, Yau-Man Chan, Eliza Orlins, and Jonathan Penner.\n\nDuring the first tribal Immunity Challenge, the Malakal tribe found themselves to be too confident they would win against the fans, only to lose, in which Jon pointed out during their first Tribal Council. Back at camp, Jon jokingly told Parvati he just got a bottle with a message in it saying his grandmother died, which Parvati laughed at and said "Nice try". Later that night, Jon expressed he was not fully committed to the game because he was thinking about his expectant girlfriend—going as far as to ask his tribe to vote him out. Regardless of the tribe's mixed reactions due to his infamous past as a schemer (e.g. lying about his grandmother's death to win a Reward Challenge), Jonny Fairplay's request was honored by the tribe, and he was voted out in a unanimous vote.	0	0	20	4	3	8	3	0.00
6	Jonathan Penner	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Penner	3	Jonathan returned as one of ten returning contestants on the Malakal tribe who competed against ten Survivor "superfans." He initially formed an alliance with Ami Cusack, Eliza Orlins, and Yau-Man Chan to usurp the budding Malakal Couples Alliance consisting of Amanda Kimmel, James Clement, Ozzy Lusth, and Parvati Shallow. While both alliances were vying for Cirie Fields's and Jon Dalton's votes after Malakal lost the first Immunity Challenge, all plans were put on hold when Jon suddenly decided that he wanted to go home to be with his expectant girlfriend and was voted out at the first Tribal Council.\n\nWhen Malakal lost immunity again on Day 8, both alliances again battled for Cirie's crucial swing vote. Although Cirie was initially on board with Jonathan's alliance, she was eventually swayed to join the Malakal Couples Alliance on the condition that Yau-Man would be the first eliminated, despite the alliance's desire to eliminate Eliza because she made an argument that if Yau-Man went to Exile Island once, he would definitely find the Hidden Immunity Idol. The couples agreed, and although Jonathan tried to save Yau-Man, he was voted out in a 6-2-1 vote.\n\nOn Day 13, unexpected tribe switch moved Jonathan to the Airai tribe with Eliza, James, and Parvati. Although Airai won the subsequent Reward Challenge, Jonathan suffered a knee injury, greatly hindering his mobility. Airai then went on a winning streak before Jonathan's knee injury started slowly getting worse and worse. Eventually, Jonathan was forced to be medically evacuated on Day 15 after the medical team determined that the infection in his knee was potentially fatal, and he shared an emotional goodbye with his tribe before leaving.	7	0	15	8	7	2.3	15	0.47
3	Yau-Man Chan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Yau-Man_Chan	2	Yau-Man returned as one of ten returning contestants who competed against ten Survivor "superfans", who gave him the most loud and positive response upon his arrival into the game. At the first individual Immunity Challenge, where the castaways were to locate an individual Immunity Idol (one per tribe) that would only be effective the first time they go to Tribal Council, Jon Dalton found one of the two idols, but mistakenly picked the Fans' Immunity Idol. Yau-Man caught him and told Kathy Sleckman where the idol for her tribe was, and then he rushed to their boat getting the idol from his tribe and accidentally slammed Jon at the hull of the boat, to the latter's chagrin.\n\nYau-Man formed an alliance with Ami Cusack, Eliza Orlins, and Jonathan Penner to try to vote out the Malakal Couples Alliance made by Amanda Kimmel, James Clement, Parvati Shallow, and Ozzy Lusth. While both voting blocs were vying for Jon and Cirie Fields's votes, all plans were put on hold when Jon suddenly decided that he wanted to go home to be with his expectant girlfriend and the tribe, honoring Jon's wishes, unanimously voted him out.\n\nOn Day 5, Malakal won the combined Reward/Immunity Challenge by a wide margin, sparing Yau-Man from elimination once more. When Malakal lost the third Immunity Challenge on Day 8, however, both alliances again battled for Cirie's crucial swing vote. Cirie eventually joined the couples' alliance on the condition that Yau-Man would be the first eliminated despite the alliance's desire to vote out Eliza for her weak challenge performances. Cirie argued that if Yau-Man went to Exile Island at least once, he would definitely find the Hidden Immunity Idol based on his success in obtaining idols in Fiji. The couples eventually agreed, sending Yau-Man home in a 6-2-1 vote.	3	0	18	8	7	1	8	0.38

12	Corinne Kaplan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Corinne_Kaplan	2	At the start of the game, Corinne was selected by Jacquie Berg to become a member of the yellow Kota tribe. On Day 4, Corinne and Jacquie were both recruited into Marcus Lehman and Charlie Herschel's Onion Alliance. To secure a majority of five on the nine-person tribe, Corinne looped Bob Crowley into the alliance for his benign demeanor and helpfulness around the camp. When Kota first lost Immunity on Day 9, Corinne joined her alliance in voting out Paloma Soto-Castillo.\n\nAt the tribe switch the following day, Corinne remained on Kota alongside the majority of her allies. As Kota remained dominant in challenges, Corinne forged a bond with ex-Fang member Randy Bailey, who was quickly absorbed into the Onion Alliance. During this time, Corinne also grew an annoyance with Dan Kay, due to his social awkwardness and consumption of the Kota's food supply. At the Double Tribal Council on Day 21, Corinne initially wanted to target Dan, but switched her ire to Susie Smith after the latter told Corinne she planned on voting against her that night.\n\nThough she ultimately followed through with her alliance's plan of voting out Dan over Susie, Corinne still held a grudge against the latter and wanted her out next if Kota lost immunity again. On Day 22 however, a second tribe-switch sent Corinne to the new Fang tribe, along with Charlie and Randy. Though the trio considered throwing the final tribal Immunity Challenge to vote out Matty Whitmore, Fang ended up winning. This unknowingly dealt a heavy blow to the Onion Alliance after Susie defected to the rival Fang Alliance to vote out Marcus on the new Kota.\n\nThe two tribes merged on Day 27, forming the Nobag tribe. With the Onion Alliance and the Fang Alliance at four members each, both groups fought for Sugar Kiper's vote. Though Corinne disliked Sugar, she attempted to win her over by promising that she and the rest of the Onion Alliance would vote Randy out after Sugar voted with them against Crystal Cox. In the end though, Sugar chose to side with the Fang Alliance in a decisive 5-4 vote against Charlie, leaving Corinne in the minority.\n\nNow on the outs, Corinne attempted to keep herself safe by bidding all her money at the Survivor Auction for an advantage at the next Immunity Challenge. This proved unsuccessful though, as she lost the challenge to Ken Hoang. Despite Corinne's best efforts to recruit Matty to her alliance ahead of the next vote, she lost another ally in Randy after he was voted out for irritating the rest of the camp, under the pretense he was safe from a fake Hidden Immunity Idol made by Bob.\n\nWith only Corinne and Bob remaining from the Onion Alliance, the pair decided to lie that they possessed a second Hidden Immunity Idol from the fake merge on Day 22 (that was actually thrown into the ocean by Marcus). After Bob won immunity on Day 33, the Fang Alliance set their sights on Corinne. However, Ken and Crystal bought the story about Corinne's idol and decided to use the opportunity to try and vote out Matty. Believing that Corinne would play her idol, Ken and Crystal decided to split the vote 4-3 between Corinne and Matty. However, as she did not actually possess an idol, this resulted in Corinne being voted out instead. She became the fourth member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Corinne asked Susie if she was willing to remove her vocal cords if she won the million dollars, which Susie refused. Corinne then asked Bob to show a nasty side of himself and make her believe that he disliked Sugar, but when he started saying something positive about Sugar, Corinne interrupted and said she did not want him being nice. When she spoke to Sugar, Corinne insulted her for her socioeconomic status and constant crying, and also added that it was insincere when Sugar cried about her dead father, to which Sugar responded by flipping the bird at her. In the end, Corinne voted for Bob to win, which he did in a 4-3-0 vote over Susie and Sugar.	11	0	7	3	7	2.5	33	0.33

16	Sugar Kiper	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sugar_Kiper	2	At the Schoolyard Pick on Day 1, Sugar was chosen by Ace Gordon to be on the Kota tribe, stating that it was not appropriate for a photographer to not have a model. When it was her turn to pick, Sugar chose Marcus Lehman. Kota won the first three challenges. However, the opposing tribe, Fang, made a comeback and won the next Reward Challenge. Fang chose to send Sugar to Exile Island where she was given the choice of searching for the Hidden Immunity Idol or living in a luxurious hut. She chose to look for the idol, which she eventually found. When Kota lost their first Immunity Challenge on Day 9, Sugar agreed that Paloma Soto-Castillo was the weakest due to her dismal performance at the last Reward Challenge and joined the majority voted her out.\n\nOn Day 10, after ranking tribe members in order of importance, a tribe switch by Schoolyard Pick occurred. Sugar was the person unpicked and was automatically exiled and would reside at Exile Island until the losing tribe's Tribal Council. Having found the idol already, she chose the hut. After the Immunity Challenge was over and being informed that Fang lost, Sugar looked forward to heading to the Fang camp, knowing that Ace and Jacquie Berg had both been switched to Fang. Much to her surprise, Jacquie was voted out over Kelly Czarnecki. The Fang tribe generally lost challenges, and Sugar was frequently exiled. Sugar felt guilty that she was eating the many foods of the hut (which she dubbed the "Sugar Shack"). At the next two Tribal Councils, Sugar was targeted by the Fang Alliance for her close relationship with Ace but was spared because GC Brown wanted to leave and Kelly was irritating the Fang Alliance.\n\nOn Day 21, host Jeff Probst announced that both tribes would be voting someone out that night at a Double Tribal Council and that the challenge was for individual immunity. Sugar made it to the final round with Ace and Marcus but was the first person out. Despite that, Marcus chose her to be the recipient of a second individual immunity. After Ken Hoang lied to her, saying that Ace was using her because of her idol, Sugar conspired with Ken and Crystal Cox to blindside Ace. The plan worked and Ace was blindsided at Tribal Council. The following day, the tribes enjoyed what was thought to be a merge feast. However, it was revealed to be a setup for a second tribe switch. Sugar stayed on Fang with Matty Whitmore and was reunited with her original Kota tribemates Charlie Herschel and Corinne Kaplan, and introduced to Randy Bailey. Although now finding herself in the minority with Matty, Fang won the next Immunity Challenge.\n\nOn Day 27, Jeff announced that the tribes had merged and that the merged tribe would stay at the Fang camp. The Onion Alliance tried to get Sugar on their side, but she stayed loyal to the Fang Alliance and joined in voting out Charlie over Crystal. Bob Crowley then told her he had the idol, but being the real holder of the idol, Sugar knew this to be a lie. At the Survivor Auction, Randy bought cookies for the tribe and offered Sugar his cookie. She took it and gave it to Matty, much to Randy's annoyance. Sugar agreed with the Fang Alliance to vote out Randy for making camp life more unbearable. Bob told Sugar that his idol was fake and she suggested to give it to Randy; Bob was reluctant at first, but eventually did give him the fake idol. At Tribal Council that night, Sugar laughed out loud when the idol was revealed to be a fraud and Randy was voted out.\n\nAt the following Tribal Council, Sugar voted out Corinne, whom she had issues with, but Ken voted against Matty as a fail-safe if Corinne had an idol. With Matty being angered by Ken's vote, Crystal starting yelling at Matty to keep his loyalty. Sugar witnessed this and viewed Crystal and Ken as bad people and helped in voting out the duo. Having made it to the final four with Bob, Matty, and Susie Smith, Sugar was set on going to the Final Tribal Council with Bob and Matty. However, her plans would would go up in smoke when Susie won the Final Immunity Challenge. Forced to choose between Bob and Matty, Bob convinced Sugar to vote against Matty to force a tiebreaker, and, being close with both men, Sugar decided to give Bob a fair chance. Bob won the tiebreaker and Matty was eliminated.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Sugar gave notoriously poor answers to the jury, such as "You don't have to vote for me," and "You're a jerk." Sugar gave Corinne the middle finger after the latter called the former an "unemployed uneducated leech on society" and claimed that it was insincere when she cried about her deceased father due to how often it happened. Ken and Crystal were angry at Sugar for betraying them near the end of the game. Sugar received none of the jury votes and finished as the second runner-up.	5	1	3	7	5	3.9	39	0.13
11	Randy Bailey	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Randy_Bailey	2	Randy was selected by Matty Whitmore to be on the Fang tribe. He decided to add Dan Kay to Fang, saying that they needed a suit. Fang was much weaker than Kota. Randy became annoyed very quickly with Gillian Larson due to her cheery personality. He also viewed her as useless to the tribe. At Fang's first Tribal Council, Randy agreed with sending the negative Michelle Chase home over the weak Gillian. Fang lost the next two challenges. Randy was happy that he was able to vote out Gillian. Also at the Tribal Council, the tribe elected GC Brown the leader. However, he quit the position. Fang made a comeback and won the next two challenges.\n\nFang was running out of rice and Randy wanted to make so they ate one meal a day. Randy knew that GC, Crystal Cox, and Ken Hoang were against him because they ignored him. He was also friendly with Dan, Matty, and Susie Smith. They all deemed GC as 'cancer' and decided he would be the next to go. On Day 10, the tribes were asked to rank each person based on how important they were. Randy was deemed the third most important person. Randy didn't care as it didn't show alliances. A tribe switch occurred, and the most important people from each tribe, Matty and Marcus Lehman, would start the process. Randy was selected by Charlie Herschel to be on the new Kota. When it was his turn, Randy picked Corinne Kaplan. Randy informed her that GC was negative and would make his tribe lose. The talk worked and Corinne chose Susie to be on the tribe. Randy scored all the goals to ensure his new tribe won immunity, which would become the start of a winning streak. Randy enjoyed winning and seeing Fang suffer. During this time, Randy joined the Onion Alliance. On Day 21, the challenge was for individual immunity as both tribes went to Tribal Council. Randy made it to the second round of the challenge, but he was eliminated by Charlie. At Tribal Council, Randy voted against Susie as she was the weakest. However, the tribe was concerned about Dan possibly having a Hidden Immunity Idol, so he was voted out instead.\n\nOn Day 22, everyone headed to what was thought to be a merge feast. Randy noticed a box and he assumed it would end the fun. There was also a note that was a clue to a Hidden Immunity Idol. Randy didn't need the note to tell him that the idol was hidden under a sagging tree branch. Everyone decided to throw the idol into the ocean. Randy felt like the "king of Gabon" because he believed that he convinced everyone to dispose of the idol. The box, instead of announcing the merge, announced another tribe switch. Randy ended up on Fang, along with Matty, Corinne, Charlie, and Sugar Kiper. Randy was worried about Susie flipping because he viewed her as "stupid and crazy". Matty won Fang immunity. Randy's fears were confirmed when they noticed that Marcus was voted out.\n\nAt the next Immunity Challenge, the tribe officially merged. Randy deflected back to Kota, but no one was able to get anyone to flip. Charlie was the one voted out. At the Survivor Auction, Randy spent all of his money on many items. Bob was exiled by Ken. Randy bought the last item, which was cookies that he had to share with the tribe. Sugar gave his last cookie to Matty, which irritated Randy. He decided to make the others lives miserable so they would vote for him. Then, he would use the idol that he believed Bob Crowley had found and blindside Susie in revenge for flipping on them. Bob gave him an idol. At Tribal Council, the plan appeared to work and Randy gave the idol to Jeff Probst. However, the idol was fake, leaving Randy dumbfounded while Sugar laughed loudly. Randy was voted out in a 5-3 vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Randy demanded to know why Bob gave him a fake idol. He also asked Sugar why she laughed at him when he got the fake idol and made it clear that he didn't want to vote for longtime enemy Susie. In the end, Randy voted for Bob to win, who wound up doing so. When he cast his jury vote, he said, "All three of you, kiss my ***".	10	1	8	3	7	4.7	30	0.33

12	Coach Wade	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Coach_Wade	3	Coach's appearance inspired some strong first impressions from other contestants, and he was excited when host Jeff Probst announced that both tribes would vote someone out right away on Day 1, eager to "get rid of the weak players before we even start". He formed the Timbira Alliance before the merge with Tyson Apostol (whom he called his assistant coach) and Debbie Beebe, and quickly took control of the Timbira tribe. Coach's leadership style and personality did make him a few enemies in Candace Smith and Erinn Lobdell, the latter claiming that Brendan Synnott made a better leader. Though Coach succeeded in voting out Candace, Erinn was spared when Jerry Sims fell ill and Timbira won the remaining pre-merge challenges. Brendan rivaled Coach's influence in the game, setting the stage for a power struggle that wouldn't be resolved until the merge.\n\nAfter the merge he made new allies with former Jalapao members Stephen Fishbach (who he called "The Wizard") and J.T. Thomas (who he called "The Warrior"). Together with previous allies Debbie and Tyson, the five became the "Power Alliance", reflecting Coach's philosophy to take the strongest players to the end. J.T. and Stephen were happy to go along with it, but as they pulled in outsider Erinn, they remained most loyal to her and original tribemate Taj.\n\nThe night Joe Dowdle was medevaced, Coach told the tribe his story about the time he was kidnapped by indigenous people when kayaking in the Amazon. The story shocked everyone, and even his closest allies questioned the authenticity of the story, though no one other than Brendan responded to ask some clarifying questions. At that point, Brendan decided he could no longer trust Coach. After Coach claimed he had prior experience breaking tiles in the Day 22 Reward Challenge, Probst would go on to playfully comment on Coach's experiences in his subsequent failures to win Reward Challenges, in particularly that one when the reward was kayaking. Coach labeled Brendan as "The Dragon" and Coach named himself the Dragon Slayer, and fulfilled this title on Day 24 when Brendan was voted out 4-3-2. \n\nAfter Brendan's elimination, Timbira continued to cave from within and Coach was a key reason for that. He constantly told Sierra Reed that she was the next to go, claiming the noble thing to do was to "fall on her sword like the Samurai". At this point, Coach became very comfortable in his position to the point that he sat out of the Day 27 Immunity Challenge for pizza and beer, which nearly proved costly as Sierra almost won. Though Debbie ultimately prevailed, Coach's plan to vote out Sierra was interrupted by the Jalapao contingent and Erinn opting to blindside physical threat Tyson instead. This blindside let to a brief attempt to try to rekindle a Timbira strong gameplan, but at that point Coach and Debbie's relationships with Sierra and Erinn were irreparable. Things did not improve even after Coach won immunity on Day 30 and finally sent Sierra home, as Debbie began to distance herself from Coach as well.\n\nThough Debbie targeted him on Day 33, Coach was spared as the Jalapao Three saw Debbie as the bigger threat. The following day, Coach cited various health issues asked J.T and Coach to send Taj and Erinn to Exile Island despite admitting the noble choice would be to send J.T. or himself since they were the only ones left that haven't gone. J.T. won the Reward Challenge and referenced that nobility in sending Coach to Exile Island. Coach once again listed his injuries and conditions but also declared he would not eat or sleep, which angered Erinn as she felt that he was minimizing her previous Exile Island experience. On Exile Island, Coach cherished the opportunity and claimed that it made him more of a man. A weakened Coach, now with a cane, approached the Immunity Challenge on Day 36, only to push J.T. to the limit in an endurance showdown. J.T. came out on top, but not without Coach audibly struggling and collapsing, the dramatics of which annoyed Erinn and Taj who were skeptical of his antics. Coach pushed for Erinn to go, which J.T. and Stephen had considered given her rude comments toward Coach in the last few days. J.T. planned on voting for Erinn anyway to keep his promise to Coach, leaving Stephen as the swing vote. At Tribal Council, Coach claimed the vote would not be a blindside as "women have good intuition", confident Erinn's fate was sealed, and read a poem he wrote just before the vote. Coach was ultimately voted out on Day 36 since Stephen decided to put his alliance with J.T., Taj Johnson-George, and Erinn ahead of the one he had with Coach and J.T.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Coach asked J.T. and Stephen for examples of honesty and integrity during later stages of the game and being the noble warrior. He respected J.T. more than he respected Stephen, so he voted for J.T. to win, writing "The Warrior" on his parchment and contributing to J.T.'s unanimous victory.	6	0	5	6	7	4.5	36	0.17

15	Stephen Fishbach	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Stephen_Fishbach	2	Stephen started the game on the Jalapao tribe; upon seeing that Sandy Burgin was on his tribe, he was assured that he would not be the first to go. At the marooning, the tribes were asked to vote for their weakest member based solely on first impressions. Like most of his tribe, Stephen voted against Sandy. Instead of eliminating her, she and Sierra Reed were given a helicopter ride to their respective camps. Upon seeing J.T. Thomas, Stephen viewed him as a "good old boy" and thought he would not be able to get along with him. When they arrived at camp, Jalapao found that Sandy had not built the shelter as she had been looking for a Hidden Immunity Idol instead, so the next day, Jalapao built a decent shelter. At the season's first challenge, Timbira narrowly defeated Jalapao to win immunity. After their loss, Carolina Eastwood started bossing people around in order to improve their camp. Aggravated with Carolina and impressed by Sandy's performance in the challenge, the tribe voted out the former over the latter.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Stephen bonded with J.T. and played into the role of being J.T.'s "eager, goofy best friend" if it meant that he would carry him far. They decided to make a pact to the end. Jalapao won the next three challenges. Everyone enjoyed the victories, knowing that Timbira was miserable. Taj aligned herself with Stephen, informing him about the Exile Alliance. Timbira finally broke Jalapao's winning streak by winning the fourth Immunity Challenge. Like everyone else, Stephen was disappointed because they would have had a 7-5 advantage at the merge. Stephen, Taj, and J.T. discussed whether to vote out the strong but antisocial Sandy or the weak yet pleasant Sydney Wheeler. In the end, the trio agreed with sending Sandy home. \n\nStephen and Taj found the Hidden Immunity Idol together, and they agreed to let Stephen keep it. Jalapao won the next challenge for a trip to the Charmin Cafe. Unfortunately, Stephen was selected by Brendan Synnott to join him on Exile Island. He was unsure about placing his fate in the hands of the Exile Alliance. After Jalapao lost yet another Immunity Challenge, the tribe agreed that Spencer Duhm was their weakest member and unanimously voted him out. Sydney was concerned that she would be the next to go because of Stephen and J.T.'s tight friendship. The Reward Challenge was very close, but Timbira won. They chose to exile Joe Dowdle and he decided to bring Erinn Lobdell with him. Taj made a fake idol to fool Joe. Taj told J.T. about the idol in order to secure his trust. J.T. told Stephen that he had seen the idol in Taj's bag. In response, Stephen explained that he and Taj were planning on telling him, further solidifying their friendship. Timbira won the next challenge, causing Jalapao to have their numbers disadvantage worsen to 4-6. J.T. and Stephen tried to persuade Joe to vote out Sydney, but he refused. Stephen and J.T. considered the possibility of voting out Taj because Stephen technically had the idol. In the end, the Jalapao Three stayed loyal and Sydney was voted out, 3-2.\n\nThe next day, the four remaining Jalapaos arrived at the merge feast, where Jalapao and Timbira became Forza. Coach Wade approached Stephen and J.T to recruit them into an alliance. Stephen was amazed at how easily the former Timbira tribe was willing to turn on each other. Unfortunately, Joe was medically evacuated because of his knee. Despite that, the Jalapao Three quickly took control of the game, consolidating their power when Erinn defected to their side. The trio sided with the Timbira Alliance to blindside Brendan, then proceeded to take out Tyson Apostol for his dominance in challenges. Stephen won the Reward Challenge, and had his allies accompany him. When they returned, Coach lied to them that Sierra Reed was trying to reorganize the original Timbira to expel Jalapao from the game. When Sierra learned of this, she accused them of lying, leading Stephen and J.T. to be suspicious of all three of the Jalapao outsiders. After careful consideration, Stephen and J.T. decided to vote Sierra out for causing drama.\n\nKnowing she was in danger, Debbie threw Coach under the bus. Debbie even stated that she would give up the Final Immunity Challenge so Stephen and J.T. could make the Final Two together. The Jalapao Three deemed Debbie the biggest threat for her strategic mindset and athleticism. At the next Immunity Challenge, Stephen used an effective memory strategy to win a mentally taxing challenge, much to his delight. Everything went as plan for the next Tribal Council, and Debbie was voted out. On the way back to camp, Stephen and J.T. informed Coach that Debbie has been targeting him. J.T selected Stephen to join him on the next reward. After J.T. won immunity and remained resolute that he would not vote against Coach, Stephen became the swing vote who would decide who between Erinn and Coach would be eliminated next. Stephen ultimately voted out Coach.\n\nAt the final four, Taj and Stephen agreed to vote J.T. off if he did not have immunity. Unfortunately, J.T. did just that and foiled the plan. Fearful of her winning immunity and taking J.T., Stephen convinced J.T. to turn on Taj. Stephen was afraid to win the Final Immunity Challenge, because he would be forced to break his promise of bringing J.T. to the finals. Erinn also wanted to take Stephen to the end as well. With J.T. winning the Final Immunity Challenge, he stuck to his Final Two pact with Stephen and brought his best friend to the end.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Stephen pleaded his case to the jury by saying how much he had grown and he and J.T. had the same strategic mindset. However, J.T. was quick to throw Stephen under the bus, framing him as disloyal and blindsiding his friend in the process. Realizing that the jury respected his opponent far more than him, Stephen accepted the vote was likely to be a shut-out. This was proven correct at the Reunion when J.T. won unanimously.	7	1	2	8	9	4.4	39	0.18

16	J.T. Thomas	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/J.T._Thomas	3	Assigned to the red Jalapao tribe, J.T. was popular and well-liked by all his tribemates and his physical prowess in challenges made him very valuable to fellow tribe member Stephen Fishbach. As of Day 2, they created a rock-solid alliance and with the help of Taj Johnson-George became the power-players, eliminating Sandy Burgin, Spencer Duhm, and Sydney Wheeler back to back in Jalapao's three straight Tribal Councils.\n\nDespite his persona and the various ways he benefited the tribe, J.T. was on the losing end when it came to tribal numbers. When Jalapao merged with Timbira, Jalapao was down in numbers 4-6. It was Coach Wade who approached him and Stephen to create a new alliance, known as the Warrior Alliance. Due to the medical evacuation of Joe Dowdle and Timbira slowly self-destructing, J.T. was able to play up his social game and play hard when it came to individual challenges, earning the respect of those voted out.\n\nIn the final few rounds of the game, J.T. began winning consecutive individual Immunity Challenges sending strategies into a tailspin after he became a target. Despite all this, the original alliance he created with Stephen was honored when J.T. took him to the Final Two over Erinn Lobdell. In the end, he became the eighteenth Sole Survivor by a vote of 7-0, winning in the series' second unanimous jury vote and becoming the first Sole Survivor to play a "Perfect Game".	11	0	1	8	7	5.1	39	0.28

9	Tyson Apostol	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tyson_Apostol	4	Tyson was initially placed on the Timbira tribe before his arrival for Survivor: Tocantins. In the first six days, Tyson stuck with the majority of the tribe, forming a particular alliance with Coach Wade, who dubbed Tyson his "assistant coach". At Timbira's first Tribal Council on Day 6, Tyson joined the rest of the tribe in voting out Candace Smith. On Day 9, Coach and Tyson wanted to blindside Erinn Lobdell instead of voting out the sick Jerry Sims. However, the rest of the tribe disagreed and voted out Jerry.\n\nAfter Timbira merged with Jalapao to form the Forza tribe on Day 19, Tyson won the first individual Immunity Challenge by outlasting former tribemate Debbie Beebe, though Tribal Council was canceled as Joe Dowdle was medically evacuated. Tyson went on to win the following Immunity Challenge as well. Coach and Tyson aligned with Stephen Fishbach, J.T. Thomas, and Debbie to form the Warrior Alliance, who blindsided Brendan Synnott with Erinn and Taj Johnson-George's cooperation.\n\nOn Day 27, Sierra Reed, whom Tyson disliked and openly antagonized, was the target after narrowly losing the Immunity Challenge to Debbie. However, J.T. and Stephen joined the other group, who decided that Tyson was more of a threat than Sierra, and Tyson was blindsided 5-3, pleasing Sierra, but shocking Coach and Debbie.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Tyson asked JT and Stephen how they helped each other. He, along with the rest of the jury, voted for J.T. to win.	8	0	8	8	8	2.2	27	0.30

19	Russell Hantz	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Russell_Hantz	4	Russell was placed on the Foa Foa tribe. He originally had a plan to dictate the entire tribe's voting politics, in which he was successful. In the first challenge, he was chosen for the leg of the race that required strength by tribal leader Mick Trimming. Foa Foa won the Reward Challenge. Right from the beginning, Russell demonstrated his preference to play through lies and deceit, creating conflicting alliances with every tribemate (mostly women) he came into contact with. He even lied about his personal life, claiming that he was a Hurricane Katrina victim. Still not contented, he became fond of wreaking psychological havoc whenever possible, even sabotaging his own tribe, as seen on Foa Foa's first night, where Hantz dumped all the water containers and burned Jaison Robinson's socks.\n\nThis plan took its toll on Foa Foa, whose subsequent failure in eight out of ten tribal challenges forced them to sacrifice six of their ten members. Marisa Calihan, Betsy Bolan, and Ashley Trainer were systematically eliminated after they caught on to Russell's dirty tactics. The only boot on Foa Foa that Russell had no authority over was Ben Browning, who he didn't want to vote out but reluctantly sided with the rest of the tribe. After Galu lost Russell Swan before a supposed Double Tribal Council twist on Day 15 because of a severe medical condition (which Hantz claimed was a partial victory for Foa Foa, since the rival tribe still lost a member), another loss sent Foa Foa back to Tribal Council, where Liz Kim was voted out when Hantz felt she was no longer needed. With only twelve people remaining, this prompted an early merger, and the two rival tribes were merged into a new tribe called Aiga. At the merge, the former Galu members outnumbered Foa Foa 2 to 1 (giving them an 8-4 majority) which created a grim outlook towards any chance of survival by the remaining (former) Foa Foa members.\n\nHis craftiness scaled new heights when he made an unthinkable Survivor first, finding several Hidden Immunity Idols without using the provided clues. With these idols at his disposal, he became nearly invincible at Tribal Council.\n\nWith the tribes merged, Russell gradually rallied the Foa Foa Four (consisting of tribe leader Mick, Jaison Robinson, Natalie White, and himself) to victory when they concocted a "divide and conquer" scheme, designed to make the former Galu tribe members turn on each other. This proved effective when Natalie turned the Galu women against cocky Erik Cardona, who was blindsided at Aiga's first Tribal Council (unknown to everyone at the time, they effectively flushed Erik's own Hidden Immunity Idol in the process). Russell, on the other hand, used his idol, though no votes were cast against him. Russell again surprised everyone when he revealed another idol at the following Tribal Council. This time, however, the effects devastated the former Galus, because it was revealed that they had voted for him. With all seven of the votes against Russell cancelled out by the idol, only the four remaining votes cast by the former Foa Foa tribe were counted, sending an unsuspecting Kelly Sharbaugh to the jury in a 4-0 vote.\n\nAfter two subsequent blindsides of former members of the Galu tribe, Russell convinced Shambo Waters to shift allegiances to the former Foa Foa tribe members, as she felt unhappy with her own tribe and had a fierce hatred towards Laura Morett. This gave the former Foa Foa tribe the edge they needed, resulted in the remaining Galu members (eventually including Shambo herself) to be picked off one by one, starting with Laura. Just when they thought that their victory was imminent, the remaining Foa Foa member's aspirations of making it to the final four were thwarted when Brett Clouser, the last remaining Galu member, went on to win a crucial Immunity Challenge, forcing the former Foa Foa members to eliminate one of their own, a task they had not faced in eighteen days. After Brett's win, Russell's closest ally Natalie became the next intended target, but Russell had plans of his own, and secretly plotted to take her to the end, assuming that he would get more jury votes. He turned the tables on Jaison, who was eliminated instead.\n\nAfter a close Final Immunity Challenge, Russell won immunity over Brett. In a last-ditch effort to stay alive, Brett tried to convince Russell to eliminate Mick instead of himself. Though Russell considered Brett's idea, the remaining Foa Foas prevailed as the last Galu member took his fall in a 3-1 vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Russell was chastised for being arrogant and overly two-faced. Despite garnering votes from Shambo and John Fincher for his aggressive gameplay, he eventually lost when the other jurors voted for Natalie instead. At the Reunion Show, Russell attempted to bribe Natalie into surrendering the Sole Survivor title to himself for $10,000, and eventually $100,000, arguing that he was more deserving than she was, but Natalie politely declined. His newfound infamy, however, did earn him the Sprint Player of the Season title, which included a $100,000 award. Jeff Probst polled the jury on who would have voted for Russell if he had taken Shambo and Jaison to the Final Three instead, and four people raised their hands which would be enough to guarantee him the win due to two people saying that they would vote for Shambo and one person saying that they would vote for Jaison.	5	3	2	7	9	7.2	39	0.13

7	Russell Swan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Russell_Swan	2	Upon arriving in Samoa, Russell was placed on Galu. Russell was elected the Tribe Leader by his tribemates on Day 1, but was reluctant to accept the position. At camp, Russell managed to lead his tribe quite well despite having to make many difficult decisions, with his leadership skills motivating Galu to win challenge after challenge.\n\nSeeing Shambo Waters' dismal performance around camp and in challenges, he sent an already alienated Shambo to be the observer of the Foa Foa tribe twice in a row, making her miss out on rewards; unbeknownst to Russell, Shambo enjoyed her visits with Foa Foa. When the downpour came in the second quarter of the game, Russell began to increase his work quota. This overexertion resulted in near-fatal consequences when Russell was evacuated during the Reward Challenge on Day 15 when his heart rate plunged, canceling the planned Double Tribal Council that night.	6	0	14	3	7	2.8	15	0.40

14	Monica Padilla	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Padilla	2	Monica was placed on the Galu tribe at the beginning of the season. Despite Galu's lengthy winning streak, at the Day 11 Immunity Challenge, Monica slowed down the tribe during the rope course portion of the challenge, allowing Foa Foa to catch up and ultimately win their first Immunity Challenge. Due to Monica's role in losing the challenge, she was targeted by several members of Galu. However, she was deemed more of an asset than Yasmin Giles, who was voted out instead.\n\nOn Day 15, it was announced that both tribes would vote someone out in a Double Tribal Council. Monica, along with Kelly Sharbaugh and Laura Morett, planned to vote out Shambo Waters because of the latter's inability to connect with the rest of tribe and possible connections to Foa Foa. Unbeknownst to Monica, the men of Galu conspired to use Shambo to join them in blindsiding Monica, hoping to separate her from Laura. However, Monica was spared after Russell Swan was medically evacuated, cancelling the vote.\n\nAfter the tribes merged into the Aiga tribe on Day 19, Monica was approached by Russell Hantz about an alliance and showed her his Hidden Immunity Idol. While she told Russell H. that she would align with him, Monica's true loyalty remained to Laura. Prior to the first merged Tribal Council, Kelly informed Monica that Erik Cardona had told the former Foa Foa members to vote out Monica. This caused almost everyone to turn against Erik and blindside him in a 10-2 vote. At this Tribal Council, Russell H. played his idol but did not garner any votes against him. Believing Russell H. did not posses another idol, Monica and the other former Galu members cast their votes against him at the following Tribal Council. Surprisingly, Russell H. found the re-hidden idol and played it, negating the Galu Alliance's votes against him and blindsiding her ally Kelly.\n\nThe next day, Monica was approached by Jaison Robinson and Mick Trimming, who told Monica that the former Foa Foa's now held a five-person alliance and wanted her to be the sixth. Monica immediately told this development to Laura, and hypothesized that Shambo had allied with the Foa Foas. The two soon realized that the upcoming vote would end with a 5-5 deadlock between the former Galus and the former Foa Foas and Shambo. Unwilling to vote out Laura, Monica concocted a plan to bluff the four Foa Foas into voting for John Fincher to avert a tie. However, John refused to go along with Monica's idea. At Tribal Council, the vote ended in a 5-5 tie between Laura and Natalie White. However, on the revote, John changed his vote to Laura, eliminating her. At the next Tribal Council, Monica voted against John with the remainder of her alliance in retaliation for voting out Laura.\n\nStill solidly in the minority, Monica talked to Russell H., hoping to convince him to vote out Shambo over the intended target, Dave Ball. Although Russell H. considered this, Dave was still voted out that night. At the Day 33 Immunity Challenge, Monica's remaining ally Brett Clouser won, putting the target on Monica. Monica approached Russell H. again, insisting that he should be voting out people that would vote for him to win. Monica also said that she knew that he was a millionaire, having been informed of this by Jaison several days earlier and that she would give her jury vote to whomever needed the money, angering Russell H. Despite her scrambling, the Foa Foa Four and Shambo followed through with their plan and Monica was voted out in a 5-2 vote. She became the sixth member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Monica started her speech by congratulating the finalists. For her question, Monica asked Mick and Natalie why the other two did not deserve to win. Mick said that Natalie was undeserving because of doing nothing more than riding Russell H.'s coattails and that Russell H. was undeserving because of his ego and pitting people against one other. Russell H. interjected and pointed out that Mick had no problem with what he was doing throughout the game. Satisfied with her answers, Monica voted for Natalie to be the Sole Survivor.	9	0	7	6	5	1.2	33	0.27
11	Laura Morett	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Laura_Morett	2	Laura began the season on the prosperous Galu tribe and enjoyed the spoils of her tribe's success and prolonged abstention from Tribal Council. On Day 12, however, Foa Foa would win immunity in large part due to Monica Padilla slowing the tribe down on the ropes. Despite that, Laura joined the tribe in eliminating Yasmin Giles for her lack of work ethic. Galu would win all remaining challenges but this would not come without its drawbacks. On Day 15, Russell Swan collapsed and was pulled from the game.\n\nAfter Russell's departure, alliances formed within Galu. Laura found herself aligned with Monica and Kelly Sharbaugh, while the men aligned themselves with Shambo Waters. Over this time the women formed a close bond, while Shambo developed a deep dislike of Laura. On Day 16, Shambo sent Laura to observe Foa Foa, much to her anger. While at Foa Foa, Laura bonded with Natalie White based on their similar interests. Russell Hantz also tried to get Laura on his side by showing her his Hidden Immunity Idol and making a Final Two deal with her, though she was skeptical of him.\n\nOn Day 19, the tribes merged and Laura immediately become the target of Russell for her strength, leadership, and conflict with Shambo. However, This plan was put on hold when Laura was able to win immunity. Meanwhile, Erik Cardona wanted to vote out Monica, with the belief that Laura would turn to him. Erik told the former Foa Foa's to vote Monica at Tribal Council, but none of them had the intention of doing so. Seeing the opportunity to further her former tribemates in the game, Natalie alerted the Galu women of his plot and Laura voted him out.\n\nLaura won immunity again on Day 24, further halting Russell's plans for her ousting. Because he used his Idol at the previous Tribal Council, Laura and her alliance voted for Russell. However, Russell shocked the Galu's when he played another idol and one of Laura's closest allies, Kelly, was eliminated instead. Laura found herself in danger when she failed to win immunity. Russell put his plans to eliminate Laura into motion, while the Galu Alliance chose to vote against Natalie to avoid a possible Idol. Monica also told the Foa Foa Four to vote for John to avoid them targeting Laura. The four did not believe her and the vote was tied 5-5, with Laura and Natalie being deadlocked. The revote seemed to indicate a second tie, but John Fincher, in order to avoid drawing rocks, changed his vote to Laura so his fate was not determined by chance.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Laura asked Russell H. what he learned about her that enabled him to beat her. All Russell H. said that Laura was the biggest threat and he had to vote her out. Unsatisfied with his answer, she voted for Natalie to be the Sole Survivor.	11	0	10	8	7	1.5	27	0.41

2	B.B. Andersen	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/B.B._Andersen	1	Bill Byron "B.B." Andersen was a contestant from Survivor: Borneo. B.B.'s pushy and overbearing demeanor irked many of his tribemates. This, combined with his statement that he would not mind being voted out, resulted in his elimination in a near-unanimous vote at the Pagong tribe's first Tribal...	2	0	15	3	4	5.5	6	0.33
16	Richard Hatch	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Hatch	2	Assigned on the Tagi tribe, Richard was initially seen as outspoken and arrogant, which rubbed his tribemates the wrong way. Richard's pomposity became evident over the coming days, such as claiming on Day 1 that he had already won the game and being deliberately unhelpful around camp. After losing the first Immunity Challenge, Richard speculated that he was in danger of being voted out due to his arrogance. He decided to target Stacey Stillman for being the weakest link. However, the tribe voted out Sonja Christopher instead as she had cost the tribe the challenge the day before.\n\nThe next day, Richard attempted to catch fish with Kelly Wiglesworth and Susan Hawk, however, they were unsuccessful. In a confessional, Richard expressed his desire to get to know Stacey better, as he had voted for her at the previous Tribal Council and revealed that Stacey believed Rudy Boesch was the one who voted for her. After revealing he was gay to the rest of the tribe, Richard was scared to tell Rudy, as he feared Rudy would be homophobic. However, after telling him, Richard was surprised to learn that Rudy was comfortable around him and even referred to Richard as one of the nicest people he had ever met. During an unaired Reward Challenge, Richard was the designated weight bearer for Tagi. He lost the challenge to Joel Klug of Pagong. However, they managed to win the subsequent Immunity Challenge on Day 6.\n\nAfter winning fishing gear at the next Reward Challenge, Richard revealed his proficiency at fishing, catching a stingray and fish for his tribe, causing some envy from Sean Kenniff. Richard's fishing ability increased his position in the tribe, with many of his tribemates praising his ability. Tagi once again lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 9, sending them back to Tribal Council. Richard again targeted Stacey for her weakness. This time, he got his way, as Stacey was voted out in a 5-2 vote. Richard then formed Survivor's first alliance on Day 10 between himself, Kelly, Rudy, and Susan. Although acknowledging having an alliance was sneaky, Richard deemed it necessary to ensure his survival for the next few rounds. Richard expressed confidence about this alliance, saying that if they stuck together, they would be unstoppable. Things began well for the alliance as Tagi was able to win the next Immunity Challenge.\n\nThe tribe later became annoyed at Dirk Been and Sean's failed attempts at catching fish as they were wasting time instead of working. Richard revealed another skill of his by performing better than anyone else with the slingshot the tribe needed for the next challenge. Despite his accuracy though, Tagi was unable to win the Reward Challenge on Day 14. At camp, Richard found a snake, and despite knowing its lethal consequences, decided to play with it. After losing the following Immunity Challenge, Richard planned with his alliance about whether they should vote out Dirk or Sean. Although they initially decided on voting for Sean, after seeing how weak Dirk had become, they changed their votes and Dirk became the Tagi Alliance's first victim. After successfully ousting Dirk, Richard became confident that he was in control of the game. The tribe started thinking about the merge and decided that winning the next Immunity Challenge was crucial in order to go into the merge with even numbers. Around camp, Richard decided to start walking around naked, which both amused and irked his tribe. The Tagi tribe managed to win immunity on Day 18, which meant they would go into the merge against Pagong tied with 5 members each.\n\nAfter merging into the Rattana tribe on Day 20, Richard's alliance had a decision to make: either vote out the former Pagong members or Sean, the only Tagi member not in the alliance. Richard expressed his surprise at Sean and Gretchen Cordy's unwillingness to form an alliance, calling it sheer stupidity. Richard bonded well with his new tribemates, learning how to play cards from Gervase Peterson and bonding with Greg Buis. He was also excited when he learned that he was still the only person in the tribe who knew how to fish. At the first Tribal Council of the merged tribe, Richard's alliance decided to target Gretchen, as she was seen as the leader of Pagong. After an unexpected 4-1-1-1-1-1-1 vote, Gretchen was voted out.\n\nThe following day, the tribe began to realize how good of a position Richard had put himself in. As he was the only person able to fish, if the tribe voted him out, they would not eat anything other than rice. Richard and Greg continued to get to know each other, with both thinking the other one was overconfident and neither knowing whether they should trust the other one. The Tagi Alliance noticed how threatening Greg could become if he stuck around and voted him out at their next Tribal Council on Day 24. Richard and Susan celebrated their position in the game, but became weary of Kelly's wavering trust in the alliance. After Rudy accidentally overcooked Richard's fish, he decided to stop fishing for a few days so the tribe would appreciate it when he did catch fish. This backfired slightly as Colleen Haskell became annoyed at Richard's attitude. This was further made worse when the women of the tribe managed to catch fish by themselves, rendering Richard useless. The former Pagong members became aware of Richard's alliance and formed their own counter alliance. Richard then celebrated his 39th birthday on Day 27 by walking around naked. This annoyed several members of the tribe which caused Richard to put his clothes back on. Richard continued to notice Kelly distancing herself from the alliance and began to wonder if she would flip on him if she got the chance. Although the counter alliance targeted Richard, his own alliance stuck together, and Richard barely made it through the next Tribal Council where the alliance piggy-backed off Sean's alphabet voting strategy to vote out Jenna Lewis.\n\nAfter surviving the last Tribal Council, Richard became delighted and considered stopping catching fish until all of the ex-Pagong members were voted out. Kelly and Susan planned on eliminating Richard at the final three and revealed that they never truly trusted him. Richard won the Immunity Challenge on Day 29, keeping him safe going into an uncertain Tribal Council. Kelly officially left the alliance and considered joining the ex-Pagong members. Sean also became uncertain with his former Tagi tribemates. However, the Tagi Alliance stayed strong once again to vote out Gervase. On Day 32, Richard joined Sean on a reward and got to eat breakfast on a yacht. Sean's father, Jim, was also on the ship and gave all of the remaining contestants a care package from their loved ones back home. At the next Immunity Challenge, Richard annoyed his tribemates by singing "99 Bottles of Beer", in hopes of throwing his tribemates off balance. He, however, did not make it halfway through his song before falling off the plank. Back at the beach, the alliance, sans Kelly, discussed voting her out due to her untrustworthiness. However, Kelly managed to win immunity, forcing them to vote out the last Pagong member remaining, Colleen.\n\nThe next day, Richard and Rudy further solidified their alliance, saying that they would never vote against each other and planned on voting out Kelly next. However, Kelly managed to win immunity again, forcing them to vote out Sean, the only person left to never be part of the alliance. Now, with nowhere left to turn, the alliance was finally forced to turn on itself. On Day 37, the final four reflected on how far they had come, commenting on how much weight they have all lost and the effect the game has had on their bodies. That night, Kelly continued her immunity streak, which put Richard in hot water. Although Richard and Rudy voted against Susan, Kelly joined Susan in voting against Richard. After both Richard and Susan pleaded their case on why they should stay, Kelly changed her vote, eliminating Susan and saving Richard.\n\nHost Jeff Probst woke the remaining three castaways up early the next day to partake in their Rites of Passage and Final Immunity Challenge. After reflecting on all of the castaways who had been voted out before them, Richard, Kelly, and Rudy began their Final Immunity Challenge. After two and a half hours, Richard came to the conclusion that both Kelly and Rudy would take him to the Final Two. Because of this, Richard stepped down, eliminating himself from the challenge. Richard's prediction proved right as Kelly voted out Rudy, bring Richard to the Final Tribal Council. On Day 39, the two finalists reflected on how far they had come. Both Richard and Kelly prepared for the questions they would be asked by the jury. After burning down their camp, the finalists headed to their Final Tribal Council.\n\nDuring his opening speech, Richard argued that he had played the best game. After being questioned by Gervase, Richard admitted that if he could change one thing about his game, he would put less trust in the other contestants. Jenna asked the finalists who they would want to see in the Final Two instead of them; Richard chose Greg and Rudy. Colleen asked Richard what character traits got him to the end. Richard answered "observation" which confused Colleen as he had not got to know anyone very well. Greg asked the two finalists to pick a number between one and ten; Richard chose seven. However, Greg later revealed that the numbers had no impact on his vote and that he had already made up his mind about who to vote for. Sean admitted that he loved Richard's "Fat Naked Fag" strategy. During Susan's speech, she called Richard whiny and a loser in life. However, Susan also compared him to a snake and Kelly to a rat. She finished her speech by lamenting that the jury should let the game end the way nature intended, for the snake to eat the rat. In the end, Richard received the votes of all of the ex-Tagi members and Greg, granting him the title of Sole Survivor in a 4-3 vote.	6	0	1	8	9	7.08	39	0.15
15	Kelly Wiglesworth	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kelly_Wiglesworth	2	Kelly, a whitewater rafting guide, started the game on the Tagi tribe. After Tagi lost the first Immunity Challenge, Kelly tried to get the women of the tribe, Sonja Christopher, Stacey Stillman, and Susan Hawk, to vote out Rudy Boesch, who many people found annoying. Kelly's plans failed when Susan decided to join the men in voting out Sonja due to her weakness in challenges, despite everybody on Tagi liking Sonja.\n\nAt Tagi's next Tribal Council, Kelly once again lobbied against Rudy. However, Susan once again voted with the men, and Stacey was voted out. On Day 11, Kelly talked with Richard Hatch and Susan about forming an alliance. The alliance later asked Rudy to join so they would have a majority.\n\nThe Day 15 Immunity Challenge required the tribe to select one rower. Kelly, who was a whitewater rafting guide, naturally took the position as the rower. Kelly went up against Pagong member Gervase Peterson. Initially, she and Richard believed her capacities on water would be beneficial, especially since they weren't sure how well Gervase would do in the challenge. The Pagong tribe got out to an early lead and never looked back, eventually winning the challenge, which upset Kelly intensely for the rest of the day.\n\nThe Tagi Alliance claimed their first victim at the following Tribal Council, voting out Dirk Been, as they were worried about his ailing health. Kelly made the merge with the other members of her alliance and Sean Kenniff. The alliance stuck together and managed to gain the majority in the new Rattana tribe, as the old Pagong members and Sean decided to vote based on their own personal feelings.\n\nThe alliance continued to systematically eliminate the remaining Pagong members. Throughout the game, Kelly formed a tight friendship with Susan, however, she started to waver from the alliance; instead, she wanted to vote out people who she thought did not deserve to be in the game. Targeted for her betrayal, Kelly was the next to go on Day 33, but she managed to win the Immunity Challenge, resulting in the last remaining ex-Pagong member still in the game, Colleen Haskell, to be voted out. Kelly was targeted again, but after she won immunity again on Day 36, this resulted in the only ex-Tagi to not be part of their alliance, Sean, being voted out.\n\nOn Day 37, Kelly won her third successive immunity, and she faced a tough decision: either vote out Susan, whom she had formed a strong friendship with, or the deceptive Richard. Kelly initially sided with Susan, forcing a 2-2 tie at Tribal Council, but at the revote, Kelly switched her vote from Richard to Susan. Kelly went on to win the Final Immunity Challenge and won the right to select who would join her in the Final Tribal Council. Kelly cast the sole vote to eliminate Rudy at Tribal Council, deeming him to be a bigger threat to win the game than Richard.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Kelly received a harsh speech given by a furious Susan since she believed that Kelly had abandoned the alliance and betrayed their friendship. Susan proceeded into comparing the Final Two to animals they lived with for the past month, with Kelly and Richard being a rat and snake respectively, asking the jury that they should vote the way Mother Nature intended, for the snake to eat the rat. Ultimately, Kelly lost to Richard by one vote, gaining the votes of ex-Pagong members Colleen, Gervase, and Jenna Lewis, becoming the first runner-up in Survivor history.	10	0	2	7	8	6.54	39	0.26
14	Rudy Boesch	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rudy_Boesch	2	Placed on the orange Tagi tribe, Rudy quickly butted heads with his tribemates by his curmudgeonly personality and forcing his survival methods as a former Navy SEAL. Because of this, Rudy received three votes following his tribe's loss at the first Immunity Challenge, but was spared over the perceived weaker Sonja Christopher.\n\nOver the days however, Rudy realized he needed to fit in with the group and began to soften up to his peers. He found himself appreciating the skills and wisdom of Richard Hatch, a fellow contestant with wilderness experience. Despite their differences, the two forged a lasting friendship which later turned into a voting alliance. Rudy was still a target when Tagi returned to Tribal Council on Day 9. Fortunately for him, the men of the tribe and Susan Hawk kept him for his work ethic over Stacey Stillman, who was considered prissy.\n\nThough initially averse to the idea of alliances, Rudy accepted being in one when Richard invited him along with Susan, and Kelly Wiglesworth. The four collected its first victim, Dirk Been, after losing the Day 15 Immunity Challenge.\n\nThe tribes merged into the Rattana tribe on Day 20 and Rudy found himself in a position very much like the one he had encountered when he first began the game. This time, however, he had an alliance on his side, and none of the Pagong tribe seemed to be playing the same way. With Greg Buis winning the first individual Immunity Challenge, the Tagi Alliance was forced to choose someone other than Pagong's biggest physical threat. Rudy suggested to his alliance that they target Gretchen Cordy, whom they saw as Pagong's leader, and their four votes proved to be enough to vote her out, as every other vote was cast for a unique player. At the next Tribal Council, Greg was the next to go, and the Tagi Alliance was able to eliminate Pagong's biggest challenge threat.\n\nBy Day 26, however, the remaining Pagong members began to realize the need to form an alliance when Colleen Haskell and Jenna Lewis shared a reward feast and discussed turning the game around and overthrowing the Tagi Alliance. The following day, Rudy proved his smarts by winning a mental Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council, the minority was not able to get the votes together, with Sean Kenniff employing his alphabet voting strategy yet again, leading to Jenna being voted out.\n\nAlthough the Tagi Alliance now firmly held the majority on the Rattana tribe, Kelly faltered from the alliance and animosity grew between her and Susan. However, the alliance stayed strong as they booted Gervase Peterson, Colleen, and Sean at the next three Tribal Councils.\n\nWith just themselves left in the game, the Tagi Alliance was finally forced to turn on each other. Kelly won another crucial Immunity Challenge, leaving only Rudy, Richard, and Susan vulnerable at Tribal Council. By this point in the game, Rudy and Richard had grown extremely close and had a Final Two deal with each other. That night, the two both voted against Susan, while Kelly and Susan voted against Richard, resulting in a tie. In the tiebreaker, Kelly changed her mind and voted against Susan, sending her to the jury.\n\nBy Day 38, Rudy was seen as the biggest threat in the game, having garnered more respect for his straightforwardness and blunt, down-to-earth personality than Kelly or Richard. At the Final Immunity Challenge, Richard stepped out of the challenge, claiming that he knew that both Rudy and Kelly would take him to the Final Tribal Council. This left Rudy to face off against Kelly, who had won several of the last few challenges. Rudy fought hard to win, but ultimately removed his hand from the idol during a revolution of positions and lost the challenge. Kelly cast the sole vote to eliminate him at that night's Tribal Council, deeming that he was more of a jury threat than Richard was.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Rudy expressed his frustration for the mistake that resulted in his loss at the Immunity Challenge the previous day, and kept his word and alliance by voting for Richard, who became the first Sole Survivor in a 4-3 vote.	6	0	3	8	6	3.92	38	0.16
9	Jenna Lewis	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jenna_Lewis	2	Jenna made her first appearance during Survivor: Borneo, where she was on the Pagong tribe. Although she annoyed some of her tribemates with her constant talking, she never really faced any danger during the pre-merge portion of the game. She helped vote out B.B. Andersen for his abrasive attitude at Pagong's first Tribal Council on Day 6.\n\nJenna formed a strong friendship with Ramona Gray, who described Jenna as her only 'white' friend. Ramona was a target though because she had been sick since the game began. After Pagong lost another Immunity Challenge on Day 12, Jenna voted out her friend at Tribal Council. Days later, Gervase Peterson made a comment around the campfire, saying that girls were the stupidest thing on the planet next to cows. This annoyed all of the female tribe members, although Joel Klug was blamed for the comment and was subsequently voted out.\n\nJenna was selected as the representative of Pagong to meet with Tagi's representative Sean Kenniff at a summit off the coast of Pagong's beach. The two were tasked with selecting a name for the merged tribe, as well as designing a tribe flag. Jenna came up with the name of Rattan, and Sean added an a to the end, making the tribe name Rattana. Throughout the night, the two joked that the summit was set up to be romantic, although there were no romantic feelings between the two.\n\nAfter returning from the summit, Jenna told Pagong that they had two minutes to gather their personal items as they were moving to the Tagi tribe for the rest of the game. After the merge, the ex-Pagong tribe members decided to vote out of conscience, not employing any strategy. Jenna cast her vote against Gervase saying, "Moo" (referring to his "girls dumber than cows" comment), but the ex-Tagi members stuck together and voted out Pagong's leader Gretchen Cordy.\n\nJenna was shocked by Gretchen's elimination and quickly became suspicious of an alliance forming between the ex-Tagi members. During the Reward Challenge on Day 23, the final nine castaways were supposed to receive videos from home, which they would compete to get to watch. Jenna was eager to see her daughters, whom she had been missing recently. Host Jeff Probst, however, announced that her tape did not make it in time for the challenge, leaving a very distraught Jenna. Even though she did not receive a video, if she won the challenge, she would be able to send a video to her daughters. Greg Buis won the challenge, making Jenna even sadder. After Jenna lost the archery challenge, she continuously shot arrows closest to the target while the rest of the tribe watched Greg's video from home.\n\nJenna expected to be voted out at the next Tribal Council. However, she was spared when the Tagi Alliance voted out Greg instead. On Day 25, after Richard Hatch decided to stop catching fish, Jenna, Colleen Haskell, Susan Hawk, and Kelly Wiglesworth went fishing instead. The women were elated when they caught a fish, saying that they no longer needed Richard to fish for them. Colleen won the Day 26 Reward Challenge and chose to bring Jenna along with her to the barbecue. Part of the reward was receiving letters from home, which made Jenna extremely happy. While enjoying the barbecue, Jenna and Colleen discussed the past few votes in which the person who was voted out had always received four votes against them. The two decided to form a counter-alliance, naming it the Barbecue Alliance. They asked Gervase and Sean to join them. Gervase joined them immediately, while Sean wanted to stick to his alphabet voting strategy, saying that if he thought his vote was going to influence the decision at Tribal Council, he would vote with them. At Tribal Council, Sean's voting strategy ended up being Jenna's downfall, as the Tagi Alliance piggybacked off his vote and eliminated Jenna. Jenna placed eighth and became the second member of the jury. After her elimination, Jenna finally got her video from home.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, she cast her vote for Kelly to win the game, although Kelly ultimately lost to Richard by a jury vote of 4-3.	6	0	8	7	4	5.22	27	0.22

13	Susan Hawk	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Susan_Hawk	2	Susan seemed to get far in the game by using her secret alliance with Richard Hatch, Kelly Wiglesworth, and Rudy Boesch during a time when other cast members did not yet use alliances, and several even considered allied voting to be "cheating." Susan liked being viewed as a stupid redneck during the game and kept her intelligence hidden in order to throw off her opponents.\n\nAs the fourth-place finisher, she became a member of the jury. At the Final Tribal Council she launched into her infamous "snakes and rats" speech about the Final Two, Richard and Kelly. In her speech, she said there are only two things on the entire island: rats and snakes. Richard was a snake scouring the jungle for prey and Kelly a rat, who just aimlessly wanders around the jungle trying to avoid the snake. Susan told the jury members that they should obey the laws of nature by letting the snake eat the rat. She also told Kelly that if she ever saw her in a desert, dying of thirst, she would not stop to give her a sip of water and that she'd like to see the vultures get her and devour her. This resulted in angering Colleen Haskell and Gervase Peterson, who voted for Kelly. Nevertheless, Richard still won 4-3.\n\nThe "rats and snakes" moment is arguably the most remembered moment in Survivor history, as the season one finale was the highest rated episode of Survivor to date and it was the first time in Survivor that anyone had ever expressed such bitterness and anger. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list.	5	0	4	7	8	5.46	37	0.14

10	Gervase Peterson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Gervase_Peterson	2	During the original Survivor season, Gervase worked only when necessary, and was able to successfully preserve much of his strength until the individual challenges in the later rounds. Although at times he appeared lazy, he claims that this was part of his strategy.\n\nAs a member of the Pagong tribe, Gervase was one of the first Survivor contestants who was forced by circumstance to eat cooked rat for sustenance, and was the very first contestant to remark that cooked rat actually tasted good, receiving mixed reactions from his tribe. On Day 16, he made a disparaging remark about women of his tribe, stating that "Girls are the stupidest things on the planet next to cows." However, his teammate Joel Klug laughed so hard that the comment was attributed to him, and the female members of Pagong voted Joel out when they lost the next Immunity Challenge.\n\nAfter the two tribes merged into the Rattana tribe on Day 20, Gervase, like the remaining members of Pagong, did not realize that former Tagi members Kelly Wiglesworth, Richard Hatch, Rudy Boesch, and Susan Hawk had formed a voting alliance until the Pagong faction had been outnumbered and outmaneuvered. The Tagi Alliance, along with former Tagi member Sean Kenniff, voted out Gervase on Day 30.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, he was turned off of voting for Richard by Sue's infamous "rats and snakes" speech. He voted for Kelly, who lost to Richard in a 4-3 vote.	8	0	7	6	4	5.6	30	0.27

18	Russell Hantz	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Russell_Hantz	4	Russell's actions in Samoa earned him a place in the show's 10-year anniversary season as one of the series' most notorious villains, albeit with none of the other contestants having seen him play. Assigned to the Villains tribe, Russell stated that he very much looked forward to playing the game with people who respect what it is. On the first day, he repeated his original strategy of aligning with the women, Danielle DiLorenzo and Parvati Shallow, since the latter was marked as a serious threat to the seven other tribemates. However, Russell's strategies were put on hold as the Villains won two consecutive Immunity Challenges. While not shunned by the other seven members yet, Russell join the rest of the tribe in voting Randy Bailey out after losing the Day 8 Reward/Immunity Challenge.\n\nAfter Randy's elimination, the Villains won a Reward Challenge on Day 9, earning them additional tools to set up camp. While unpacking the items, Russell found a note sticking out from a knife's scabbard. Rob Mariano, who also saw the note, compelled Russell to share its contents. The note turned out to be a clue to the whereabouts of a Hidden Immunity Idol buried somewhere at camp. Sandra Diaz-Twine, a member of Rob's alliance, made an ultimatum, saying that whoever tries to look for the idol will be targeted immediately. Despite the warning, Russell searched for the idol anyway and eventually found it, but he was caught by Sandra. The incident revealed the two opposing alliances in the tribe: Russell, Parvati, and Danielle on one side, and Rob, Sandra, Tyson Apostol, Courtney Yates, Coach Wade, and Jerri Manthey on the other. The tribe, however, remained dominant, winning five consecutive challenges.\n\nOn Day 15, a Double Tribal Council twist sent the Villains to their second Tribal Council. That afternoon, Rob proposed a simple solution to eliminate the threat of Russell's idol: split their six votes between Russell and Parvati (Rob, Sandra, and Tyson would vote Russell, while Courtney, Jerri, and Coach would vote Parvati), eliminating one of them, assuming if either person plays the idol. That way, it would enforce a tie between whoever Russell, Parvati, and Danielle voted, and whoever between Russell or Parvati remained vulnerable; and with the majority of Rob's alliance eligible for the re-vote, it would be clear that whoever did not play the idol will be sent home. Aware of Rob's plan, he tricked Tyson into voting for Parvati to save himself. At Tribal Council, Russell drew the idol as expected; but pulled a double-cross by handing his idol to Parvati. But in a stunning turn of events, Tyson fell for Russell's trickery by casting a fourth vote against Parvati, eliminating himself after a 3-2-0 vote.\n\nDespite his successful blindside of Tyson, Russell's alliance was still outnumbered 5-3. That is, until he made moves on faltering members Jerri and Coach, promising to take them to the end. Jerri accepted, with Coach still conflicted. After the Villains lost the next Immunity Challenge, Russell was ready to take down Rob with Jerri's support. Coach ultimately decided to not go with either alliance and vote off Courtney. Rob only had three members now and despite his efforts, Boston Rob was voted out by Russell's alliance in a 4-3-1 vote. This would send the Villains to a downward spiral.\n\nBefore the Day 19 Reward Challenge, the Villains mistook the Tree Mail for a cryptic message for the upcoming merge. The tribe showed up to the challenge bringing all their belongings, including their dismantled shelter and supplies. The Heroes tribe noticed that only the male Villains were eliminated. Deducing that Parvati ran a women's alliance, J.T. Thomas whispered to Russell to "hang in there," implying his intention to align with him. The Villains lost the challenge, forcing them to return to camp empty-handed and re-establish their shelter.\n\nKnowing Russell's aggressive nature to those who tried to target him, Sandra seized the opportunity to save Courtney by tricking Russell into voting the floater Coach. After losing the Day 21 Immunity Challenge, Russell had arguments with Danielle on which between Coach and Courtney should go home. With the alliance unsettled on who to vote for, Russell and Jerri joined Coach and voted for Courtney, while Danielle and Parvati joined Sandra and Courtney, voting Coach out 4-3.\n\nOn the Day 22 Reward Challenge, Coach's elimination made the Heroes set in believing that the women were running the tribe. Seeing that the Heroes were making a mistake in believing such, Russell acted vulnerable to them, pretending that he needed help. The Villains won the challenge, winning themselves an all-you-can-eat buffet from Outback Steakhouse. While the Villains enjoyed their lunch, Parvati saw a clue to the Villains' re-hidden idol tucked in her table napkin. To ensure her own fate in the game, Parvati left Russell uninformed and only disclosed the clue to Danielle. Over at the Heroes tribe, the tribe decided to give Russell their own Hidden Immunity Idol should the Villains lose the next Immunity Challenge. J.T. even wrote a letter to Russell, telling him to use the idol and vote Parvati out. The Villains indeed lost the Immunity Challenge in Day 24; and while shaking hands with the enemy, Russell accepted the Heroes' idol through Colby Donaldson. Russell showed the idol and read J.T.'s letter aloud to Parvati and Danielle, mocking his reputation as a former Sole Survivor. Though Courtney begged Parvati for her survival, Parvati was not able to convince Russell to keep her, and Courtney was voted out, 5-1.\n\nOn Day 25, the tribes merged with five members each. The Heroes were surprised that Parvati was still in the game. Russell fabricated an elaborate story about him and Parvati playing conflicting idols that night. Sandra, the last remaining member of her alliance, warned the Heroes that there was no all-female alliance, and Russell was the mastermind behind all that has happened in the Villains tribe. Wanting to test his true loyalties, the Heroes openly told Russell they would vote for Parvati. In order to save Parvati for a second time, Russell handed the Heroes' idol to her. Unknown to Russell, Parvati already possessed the Villains' idol. Sensing that she might not be the Heroes' target after all, Parvati, now having two idols, gave both to Sandra and Jerri, much to Russell's surprise. Russell fumed over not knowing that Parvati had her own idol after giving one to her, saying that leaving him uninformed was unnecessary.\n\nRussell felt Sandra would flip to the Heroes, and convinced Candice Woodcock to betray her former tribe and vote off Amanda Kimmel. This was successful, and Sandra did not flip to the Heroes, and Amanda was voted off in a 6-3 vote. That night, Russell found another Hidden Immunity Idol, thanks to Danielle, who obtained a clue to its whereabouts after winning the Reward Challenge. He used the idol at Tribal Council, but for naught, as nobody voted for him.\n\nThe next day, Russell was confronted by Rupert Boneham for his deceptions, where Russell derisively called him "the second coming of Christ" before giving him a middle finger. Russell then declared that whoever threatens him will go home. At the Immunity Challenge, where Russell's ally Parvati won individual immunity, a twist was revealed to the castaways, revealing that there was another Hidden Immunity Idol buried at camp. Returning from the challenge, Russell and the rest of the tribe searched for the idol. That afternoon, Russell saw Rupert tucking something in his pocket, suspecting that it was the idol. Unknown to the tribe, Sandra found it and kept her possession a secret to everyone, and Rupert had merely placed a rock in his pocket as a decoy, to force the Villains to split the vote between him and Candice. This prompted Jerri, Danielle, and Parvati to rethink their voting options. At Tribal Council, Russell, Sandra, and Jerri joined Rupert and Colby by voting Candice out after a 5-3 vote.\n\nAfter winning individual immunity the next day, Russell worried that Parvati was more loyal to Danielle than she was to him, and decided to pit them against each other. Russell discussed Parvati's blindside to Danielle, and told Parvati that Danielle was gunning for her. Russell decided to vote out Danielle, and although her and Parvati learned the truth, Jerri sided with Russell to vote out Danielle after Danielle unintentionally revealed Jerri was fourth in their alliance. To gain the majority, Russell told the two remaining Heroes, Colby and Rupert, that he would keep them if they voted Danielle out with him. They agreed, and Danielle was voted out 4-3.\n\nA loved ones Reward Challenge took place On Day 34, where Jerri won and invited Parvati and Sandra, and their respective loved ones, to join her. Russell, angry that Jerri did not pick him, decided to turn on Parvati by making a new alliance with Colby and Rupert. They agreed and Russell felt that Jerri could join his new alliance. Russell's plans were foiled when Parvati won individual immunity. Unknown to Russell, Sandra had found the idol; and while she did not need to use it, the Villains again prevailed, voting Rupert out, 4-0. Russell and the Villains would then finish off the Heroes by voting Colby out 4-1 on Day 37.\n\nOn Day 38, in a closely-contested Final Immunity Challenge between Jerri, Parvati, and Russell, Russell prevailed, securing his spot at the Final Tribal Council. That afternoon, Russell felt that they should eliminate Jerri. Under the premise that Jerri might win, Russell covered up his true intention in voting Jerri out: He assumed that Jerri would vote for him at Final Tribal Council, and taking Sandra to the end would be an easy win for him. Parvati, on the other hand, believed that Sandra should go, as the Heroes, who had five seats in the jury, would favor her. In the end, Russell sent Jerri to the jury anyway, after a 3-1 vote.\n\nOn Day 39, Sandra wanted to get even to Russell for eliminating her alliance and all the other atrocities he had done. She secretly burned his hat, to her and Parvati's entertainment. Russell tried to look for his hat, not knowing it was already in ashes. At the Final Tribal Council, Russell faced heavy criticism from the jury, mostly from the Heroes; as he was castigated for not only for his numerous betrayals, but for his mistreatment of the Heroes, and his sense of self-entitlement. The Villains also praised Parvati and Sandra's gameplay more than Russell's. In the end, Russell received no jury votes, Parvati got three, and Sandra was crowned Sole Survivor for the second time, with six, much to Russell's disgust.\n\nAt the live Reunion Show, Russell launched a tirade after his loss, calling Sandra "undeserving," and the game "flawed." Russell then revealed that he had kept and laminated the letter written to him by J.T. when he gave up his Hidden Immunity Idol to him. In response, J.T. grabbed the letter and attempted to burn it in a fire set up in front of the castaways and the audience which erupted laughter, but Russell managed to retrieve it before it got burned. Russell's notoriety gave him his second consecutive Fan Favorite Award, winning him an extra $100,000.	10	3	3	6	9	4.9	39	0.26
15	Rupert Boneham	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rupert_Boneham	4	Rupert's popularity in his two prior seasons earned him a spot on the Heroes tribe. When the Heroes lost the first Immunity Challenge, Rupert joined the majority in voting out Sugar Kiper. When Heroes lost thes second Immunity Challenge, Rupert joined the Heroes Alliance, and aided them in voting out Stephenie LaGrossa. At the Hero's third Tribal Council, he voted for Colby Donaldson, but after alliance leader J.T. Thomas voted against Cirie Fields, she was blindsided. When the Heroes went to their fourth Tribal Council, he contributed to Tom Westman's elimination. On Day 15, both tribes had to go to Tribal Council. While Colby was the outsider, Rupert and his allies minus James Clement spared Colby and voted out James because of his foot injury. At the next Reward Challenge,the Heroes particularly Rupert believed that an all girls alliance was formed on the Villains tribe, and Rupert pointed that out. The Heroes won the remaining Immunity Challenges before the merge.\n\nWhen the merged occurred, Rupert and his allies believed Villains member Russell Hantz whom they perceived was the outsider was on their side. However, after Villains member Sandra Diaz-Twine told him Russell was in control on the Villains tribe and there was no all girls alliance, Rupert voiced his concern to his allies. At Tribal Council, Rupert voted for Jerri Manthey, but Parvati Shallow gave Hidden Immunity Idols to Sandra and Jerri, blindsiding J.T.\n\nOn Day 30, Sandra talked to Rupert and told him that Russell had to go. However, at Tribal Council, Sandra sided with Russell, and alliance member Candice Woodcock flipped to Russell's alliance, thus blindsiding alliance member Amanda Kimmel. Rupert and Colby were now the only loyal Heroes left. The following morning, Rupert voiced his disgust at Russell by calling him out during breakfast for being a terrible human being. Russell said all of his actions are just part of the game, but Rupert said he has played twice before and never stooped as low as Russell. The argument quickly devolves into personal insults and attacks between the two men as the rest of the tribe watches on. Rupert was unable to win immunity.\n\nAt camp, Rupert, knowing he is the main target of the Villains at this point, hatches a plan to keep himself around by faking that he has the idol. Rupert takes a large stone from the river and puts it in his pocket to make it look like he has an idol. As Rupert returned to camp, Russell saw him and the bulge in Rupert's side pocket and immediately believed that Rupert found the idol. Colby and Rupert met out in the jungle to talk about what the Villains planned on doing. Colby said they'd probably split the votes three on Rupert, and another three on either Colby or Candice. They came up with a plan to put their own votes on Candice, so if the Villains do ended up splitting on Candice, she would go home five votes to three. At the vote, the Villains split the votes three each for Rupert and Candice, while Rupert and Colby voted for Candice, blindsiding her unexpectedly 5-3.\n\nRussell narrowly defeated Rupert to win the next Immunity Challenge. At camp, Russell targeted Danielle DiLorenzo, and recruited Rupert and Colby. At Tribal Council, Rupert received three votes, but Jerri, who was upset after Danielle stated Jerri was on the bottom, sided with the three men so Danielle was blindsided. On Day 35, Jerri won the Loved Ones Challenge and chose to take Parvati and Sandra on reward. At camp, Russell was angry that Jerri did not take him, Rupert played off Russell and built him up into being even more upset and angry at his alliance, then Russell aligned with Rupert and Colby and they agreed to vote out Parvati. However, Parvati won immunity. Sandra approached Rupert and told him she hated Russell and was sick of him. Sandra told him the only reason the girls keep Russell is around is because everyone hates him so bad they know they'll win against him at the end. Rupert, however, shunned Sandra and went back to Russell. Rupert talked to Russell by the campfire as Parvati and Sandra lay in the shelter. Rupert whispered and told Russell the girls still wanted him out, calling out Sandra. At Tribal Council, Rupert and Colby voted for Sandra, but Russell betrayed them and voted for Rupert, Sandra played her idol which negated Rupert's and Colby's votes so Rupert was voted out. After his torch was snuffed, he angrily glared at the final 5.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Rupert berated Russell for his numerous lies and betrayals, thanked Sandra for trying to help the Heroes, and praised Parvati for her challenge performances. He voted for Sandra to win again, which she did in a 6-3-0 vote over Parvati and Russell.	7	0	6	8	7	2.9	36	0.19
14	Danielle DiLorenzo	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Danielle_DiLorenzo	2	Due to her betrayal of Terry in Panama, Danielle returned in Heroes vs. Villains as a member of the Villains tribe. Danielle was approached by Russell Hantz during the first few hours of the game in order to form an alliance. She agreed and together with Parvati, they formed an alliance of three. The alliance was in the minority of the Villains tribe, being opposed by a strong alliance of six. The Villains managed to win the first two Immunity Challenges, keeping Danielle's alliance from being tested. Despite their strength in challenges, the Villains struggled with camp life, having to constantly rebuild their shelter. Danielle celebrated with the rest of her tribe after winning a tarp at the second Immunity Challenge and congratulated Rob Mariano on leading the tribe to victory.\n\nAt the next Immunity Challenge, Danielle was paired up against Amanda Kimmel from the Heroes tribe. Danielle lost her round and the Villains went on to lose the challenge. Back at camp the tribe was split between voting out Randy Bailey for his weakness in challenges or Parvati for her potential as a threat. Danielle lobbied to keep her ally safe and voted for Randy, who was unanimously voted out. The Villains managed to regain their winning streak, winning the next two Immunity Challenges. After Jeff Probst revealed that the next Tribal Council would be a Double Tribal Council, Danielle's alliance would finally be tested. The majority alliance planned on splitting their votes between Parvati and Russell, while Danielle's alliance planned to vote out Tyson Apostol, Rob's closest ally, as Rob has won immunity. Danielle was convinced that one of her allies was going to be eliminated, however after Tyson changed his vote and Russell played his Hidden Immunity Idol, her alliance survived and Tyson was blindsided instead.\n\nAfter surviving the last Tribal Council, Danielle celebrated along with Parvati and Russell. The rest of the tribe could hear their celebrations and wondered how they could be so confident despite still being in the minority. Although initially skeptic, Danielle tried to convince Jerri Manthey to join her alliance. Jerri showed interest in working with them, but remained noncommittal. After losing the Immunity Challenge Danielle talks with Coach about voting out Courtney Yates, who struggled at the Immunity Challenge. However, after finding out Rob was targeting Russell, Russell wanted to vote out Rob instead. Danielle questioned whether this was a smart decision as Rob was one of the strongest members of the tribe. At Tribal Council, Danielle admits that she thinks voting out Tyson strengthened the tribe and brought them together. In the end, Danielle's alliance managed to convince Jerri to join them and they managed to vote out Rob in a 4-3-1 vote.\n\nNow finally in a majority position Danielle laughed openly at how fun Tribal Council was. After reading Tree Mail for the next challenge the Villains became convinced that they would be merging. They packed up their camp and brought everything they thought might be important to the challenge, only to be told by Jeff that they would not be merging. At camp Danielle got in a shouting match with Sandra Diaz-Twine and Courtney Yates over the bad decision to sit them out of the Reward Challenge. In a confessional Sandra revealed her hatred for Danielle. Russell revealed his desire to get rid of Coach if the Villains lose the next challenge. Danielle disagreed, believing that getting rid of Sandra or Courtney would be smarter. Their disagreement lead to a shouting match between Russell and Danielle, which ends in name calling and Russell walking off in anger. Danielle later talks about her annoyance at Russell having to control everything and admits that she is up in the air about what to do. Although Russell comes to Danielle and expresses that he may be willing to vote out Courtney, at Tribal Council Danielle joined the women and voted out Coach. Ironically Russell voted for Courtney while Danielle voted for Coach.\n\nJerri came to Danielle and admitted that she was worried about being on the outs of the tribe after voting for Courtney as the last Tribal Council, but Danielle manages to convince her that she is safe. The Villains won the next Reward Challenge and while on reward Parvati managed to find the clue to a Hidden Immunity Idol. Parvati shared the clue with Danielle to solidify the friendship between them and together decide to keep the clue from Russell. The two women woke up early the next day and found the Idol near the roots of a tree. The Villains once again lost the Immunity Challenge and the threesome of Danielle, Russell and Parvati had to decide between voting out Courtney or Sandra. Russell also revealed that J.T. Thomas from the Heroes tribe gave him the Heroes Hidden Immunity Idol at the last challenge and a letter saying that Russell should vote out Parvati. At Tribal Council Danielle's alliance decided that Courtney was a bigger liability and voted her out.\n\nDanielle and Parvati went to retrieve Tree Mail, which revealed that they had reached the merge. The Villains quickly pack up their camp and everyone except Sandra meet and discuss how they will convince J.T. and the rest of the Heroes to trust Russell when they merge. After forming the Yin Yang tribe Danielle comforts Parvati after none of the Heroes want to talk to her and agree to play along with the Heroes overconfidence. Danielle and Parvati unintentionally upset the ex-Heroes by eating their plantains. At the first Individual Immunity Challenge, Danielle outlasted Parvati to win immunity. As the Heroes and Villains are tied at five members each both tribes tried to think of ways to gain the majority. The Heroes were convinced that they could trust Russell, so they got Russell to tell the Heroes to vote for Parvati. At Tribal Council, after being warned by Sandra, the Heroes voted for Jerri. However, Parvati played both her Idol, and the Idol Russell gave her on Sandra and Jerri. This nullified the Heroes voted and gave the Villains the majority as they successfully voted out J.T..\n\nThe Heroes began to notice the alliance of Russell, Parvati, and Danielle and planned on breaking it up. At the Reward Challenge, the team of Colby Donaldson, Amanda, and Danielle won. They won a trip to the Robert Louis Stevenson house and got to watch Treasure Island. While eating popcorn, Danielle discovered a clue to the next Hidden Immunity Idol. Amanda tried to steal the clue from Danielle, which lead to a fight between the two. Colby told Amanda to give the clue back to Danielle. Back at camp Danielle shared her Idol clue with her alliance and later Russell found the Idol at a stream. The Heroes become convinced that Danielle found the Idol, which made them weary of targeting her. At Tribal Council Danielle voted for Amanda because of their earlier fight and for Amanda being the smartest Hero left.\n\nNow that the Villains had a clear majority over the Heroes they decided to split the votes between Candice Woodcock and Colby. Their plan worked and Candice was voted out at the next Tribal Council. Russell became jealous of how close Danielle and Parvati had become and told both Danielle and Parvati that the other one was targeting them. Danielle didn't believe Russell and talked to Parvati about his accusations. After finding out that Russell had made up everything they figured out that Russell was planning on voting one Danielle next. Danielle and Parvati scrambled to keep Danielle safe and talk to Sandra and Jerri about sticking with them and voting out Rupert Boneham. Although both agree, as voting out the Heroes makes the most sense to them, at Tribal Council Danielle reveals that Jerri was never part of their original alliance, which causes Jerri to lose trust in her. Russell began to attack and insult Danielle, eventually causing her to break down in tears. Danielle put the final nail in her coffin by telling Russell that her and Parvati were closer than he thought, leading her to be blindsided in a 4-3 vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Danielle starts by congratulating the Final Three on how far they have come. She then berated Russell for his lack of jury management and asked him if he would change anything about his game if he could. After Russell answered that he would not change anything, Danielle told him that no one respected him. Danielle voted for Parvati to win due to their friendship and for overcoming major odds.	10	0	7	7	8	0.7	33	0.30
6	Tyson Apostol	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tyson_Apostol	4	Tyson returned for Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains and was initially placed on the Villains tribe. The Villains dominated the initial Immunity Challenges, only losing once on Day 8, after which the tribe unanimously voted out Randy Bailey. After forming an alliance with Jerri Manthey and fellow Tocantins returnee Coach Wade, Tyson appeared to be safe after joining the alliance of Rob Mariano, Sandra Diaz-Twine, and Courtney Yates, along with Coach and Jerri. This group held a majority over the bloc of Russell Hantz, Parvati Shallow, and Danielle DiLorenzo.\n\nOn Day 15, both the Heroes and Villains had to vote someone out after the Immunity Challenge in a Double Tribal Council. Rob knew that Russell had a Hidden Immunity Idol, so he directed his alliance to split their votes; thus, if Russell gave the idol to Parvati to play, then Russell would be eliminated, and if instead Russell played the idol himself, Parvati would be eliminated.\n\nAnticipating that Parvati and Danielle might vote for Russell in an attempt to save themselves, and believing that Russell would not risk being eliminated by his own idol, Tyson deviated from the plan at the last moment, voting for Parvati at Tribal Council. After Russell gave Parvati the Hidden Immunity Idol and she played it, Tyson was voted out by a vote of 3-2-0 (had Tyson stuck to the vote-splitting plan, he and Russell would have tied 3-3, and Russell would have been eliminated by the majority alliance on the revote.) Tyson was the sixth castaway and the second Villain to be voted out of the game. Tyson's essentially voting himself out of the game has been called one of the dumbest moves in Survivor history. He realized that he cost himself the game upon exiting, but then claimed that he is "still pretty awesome".	7	0	15	5	3	1	15	0.47
1	Sugar Kiper	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sugar_Kiper	2	Sugar was assigned to the Heroes tribe due to her wanting to keep the "good people" around in her first season. During a very physical Reward Challenge following the marooning on Day 1, Villains member Sandra Diaz-Twine attempted to fluster Sugar by undoing her bra. However, Sugar decided to let the bra go and rush to her tribe's finish mat topless and flipping the bird on Sandra, winning a point for her tribe, helping the Heroes win the challenge.\n\nAt camp, however, Sugar was seen to be less helpful than the other members of her tribe. She seemed more interested in flirting and cuddling with the guys, notably Colby Donaldson, visibly annoying him and following him around everywhere when he attempted to get away from her. At the first Immunity Challenge, Sugar was placed on the puzzle station. Despite an early lead, the Heroes faltered on the puzzle portion of the challenge, costing them immunity. Immediately after the loss, Sugar was seen in tears. Back at camp, Sugar, being one of the puzzle builders, was one of the people blamed for the loss. Despite still not helping her tribe at all, some other tribe members considered keeping her around and voting out a player who would be more dangerous deeper in the game, such as Cirie Fields or Stephenie LaGrossa. When it came to the vote, the entire tribe, motivated by Sugar's personality quirks and potential liability in future challenges, unanimously sent her home.	1	0	20	3	2	2	3	0.33
7	James Clement	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/James_Clement	3	Due to his kind nature and "gentle giant" persona, James was assigned to the Heroes tribe. This season, James became frustrated and angry at his tribemates overtime for their lack of teamwork when it came to competing against the Villains, and during the Tribal Council when Stephenie LaGrossa was eliminated, this sudden change of attitude was not well received.\n\nAt a Reward Challenge, James was once again injured and was treated by the Medical Team. With the tribe unaware of whether or not he'd return, several people contemplated his return to the game and whether or not it would benefit them. James returned later on that day with his leg in a cast. Although still mobile, he was weakened and could not commit to his usual work ethic.\n\nLosing consecutive challenges, James knew he was on the chopping block, but attempted to show he was still a valuable asset by racing J.T. Thomas, though he lost badly. Ultimately, it came down to "banana etiquette" as he was voted out on Day 15 for being too much of a liability to his tribe.	2	0	14	5	4	1.3	15	0.13
20	Sandra Diaz-Twine	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sandra_Diaz-Twine	5	Sandra started the game openly announcing she did not deserve to be assigned to the Villains tribe. Regardless, she became a member of the majority alliance with Coach Wade, Courtney Yates, Jerri Manthey, Rob Mariano, and Tyson Apostol, with Courtney and Rob being her biggest allies. The Villains enjoyed early success in challenges, only losing to the rival Heroes tribe once, with Randy Bailey being voted out at their first Tribal Council on Day 8. The following day, a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol came with the Villains' reward. However, the clue fell out and was revealed in front of the whole tribe. With Sandra threatening that whoever looked for the idol would be marked and voted out at the next Tribal Council, the tribe agreed to punish anyone who did. However, after Rob suspected that Russell Hantz went looking for the idol, Sandra went to spy on him at her alliance's behest. After Sandra spotted Russell looking for the idol, the alliance agreed to vote him out next.\n\nWhen host Jeff Probst revealed on Day 15 that both tribes would vote someone out in a Double Tribal Council that night, the majority alliance planned to get split their votes 3-3, between Russell and his ally Parvati Shallow to flush out the idol. However, Tyson foolishly cast a fourth vote for Parvati, leading to his own elimination when Russell unexpectedly played the idol for Parvati rather than on himself; Tyson was eliminated by a 3-2-0 vote against Russell.\n\nAfter this, the majority alliance crumbled. Coach and Jerri both defected to Russell's alliance, and Rob was voted out at the next Tribal Council. When the Villains again lost immunity on Day 21, Sandra lied to Russell, telling him that Coach was gunning for him; Russell bought the lie and Coach was voted out 4-3. Despite the Villains winning the next Reward Challenge, the tribe again lost at the subsequent Immunity Challenge and Courtney was voted out unanimously, with Sandra voting against her ally to protect herself, leaving Sandra at the bottom of the Villains' alliance at the merge.\n\nThe Heroes and Villains merged with five members each on the Yin Yang tribe. Eager to defect, Sandra tried to warn her friend and former Pearl Islands ally Rupert Boneham and the other Heroes about Russell lying about the existence of an all-female alliance, to not trust him, and that she was willing to flip and help the Heroes Alliance. She warned that the Villains had every intention of sticking together, and Russell had no plans to help them. Though Rupert wondered if what Sandra said was true, the other Heroes refused to believe this after J.T. Thomas had already given Russell his Hidden Immunity Idol, which Russell would then pass on to Parvati. At the merged tribe's first Tribal Council, Parvati played two idols for Sandra and Jerri, negating all five of the Heroes' votes against Jerri and leaving J.T. to be voted out with all five of the Villains' votes.\n\nAt the final nine, Sandra would again attempt to switch to the Heroes' side, but she would be thwarted by Candice Woodcock flipping to the Villains, sending Amanda Kimmel to the jury. After the Immunity Challenge the following day, Jeff Probst read a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol aloud to the entire tribe. In the ensuing scramble, Sandra was the one to find the idol, choosing to keep it to herself. At Tribal Council that night, Candice was voted out after Rupert and Colby Donaldson piled their votes on her to save themselves when the Villains split their votes. The Tribal Council began to expose fractures within the Villains alliance, with Russell now wanting to target his own allies Danielle DiLorenzo and Parvati. At the next Tribal Council on Day 33, Sandra stuck with Danielle and Parvati in voting against Rupert. However, Jerri and Russell voted with the Heroes to send Danielle home in a 4-3 vote.\n\nSandra made one last attempt to help the Heroes, but Rupert would instead try to work with Russell, and told of Sandra's plan to Russell, leaving Sandra no choice but to vote him out. Sandra, sensing danger, played her Hidden Immunity Idol for safety, negating two votes against her, but Rupert would have been voted out 4-2 regardless. The next day, Colby was voted out for being the last Hero standing; the Villains, seemingly unaware of the large jury threat Sandra posed, did not target her. Russell wanted Jerri to be voted out, while Jerri targeted Parvati. Parvati wanted Sandra voted out, believing that she was the biggest jury threat, but after Russell won the Final Immunity Challenge, Parvati was forced to go along with the others in voting Jerri out.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Sandra played up that she had wanted Russell out since Day 1, that she had interacted well with both sides and many times tried to help the Heroes, and emphasized her ability to get to the end despite losing her core allies early and being at the bottom of the Villains alliance. Parvati attempted to point out Sandra's poor performance in challenges and lack of any big strategic moves. However, all five of the Heroes jury members, along with close friend Courtney, awarded Sandra their votes, giving Sandra her historic second Sole Survivor title, with 6 votes to 3 for Parvati and 0 for Russell.	8	0	1	8	9	1.9	39	0.21
10	Courtney Yates	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Courtney_Yates	2	For her sharp-tongued and fiery attitude, Courtney entered the game as a member of the Villains tribe. Early in the game, Courtney was recruited into Rob Mariano's majority alliance, where she would form a special bond with Sandra Diaz-Twine, as they would often be sat out challenges together. When Jeff Probst revealed on Day 15 that both tribes would vote someone out in a Double Tribal Council, Courtney's alliance planned to split their votes 3-3 between Russell Hantz and Parvati Shallow to flush out any potential Hidden Immunity Idol. However, due to the combination of Tyson Apostol casting a fourth vote for Parvati and an idol play on her from Russell, Tyson was eliminated instead.\n\nFollowing Tyson's elimination, Courtney's alliance would continue to fracture. Coach Wade swore his allegiance to both Rob and Russell, and pushed to vote out Courtney when the Villains lost immunity on Day 18. At the same time, Jerri Manthey defected to Russell's alliance, causing Rob's elimination. Now on the outs alongside Sandra, Courtney appeared next in line to be voted out after the Villains lost again on Day 21. However, she was narrowly spared in a 4-3 vote after Sandra tricked Russell into believing Coach was planning to vote him out.\n\nIn spite of this reprieve, when the Villains lost immunity for a third consecutive time, Courtney was targeted once more, specifically due to her connection with Amanda Kimmel from the Heroes tribe. Despite her best efforts to turn the vote onto Jerri, Courtney was voted out unanimously at Tribal Council on Day 24, becoming the second member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Courtney did not address Russell, but complimented Parvati for her athleticism and also highlighted Sandra's loyalty, which she viewed as an underestimated quality. In the end, Courtney joined all of the original Heroes in voting for Sandra to win the game, who defeated Parvati and Russell in a 6-3-0 vote.	8	0	11	7	6	0.4	24	0.33
2	Stephenie LaGrossa	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Stephenie_LaGrossa	3	Despite her more cutthroat approach in Guatemala, because Stephenie was still better associated with her underdog showing in Palau, she returned in the 10th anniversary/20th season, Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains, as one of ten Heroes. After participating in the first round of the opening Reward Challenge, Stephenie suffered a dislocated shoulder, though the injury was easily remedied by the medical team.\n\nAn immediate outsider, Stephenie was in the minority alliance with Colby Donaldson and fellow Palau castmate Tom Westman, though the three were kept around over Sugar Kiper who was perceived as a liability in challenges. The majority alliance consisting of James Clement, Rupert Boneham, Amanda Kimmel, J.T. Thomas, Cirie Fields, and Candice Woodcock was formed.\n\nDuring the second Immunity Challenge, Stephenie caught the ire of James, who was frustrated by her during the puzzle-solving portion, attributing to their second loss. James later accused Stephenie of being the reason that any tribe she was on was sure to lose, bringing up Ulong's infamous losing streak. The debacle between James and Stephenie carried over at camp and at Tribal Council with Tom and Colby being the only ones to come to her defense. In the end, the Heroes majority alliance eliminated her in a 6-3 vote. On her way out, Stephenie suggested to her tribe to bicker less, but James shot her down.	1	0	19	6	4	3	6	0.17
9	Coach Wade	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Coach_Wade	3	Coach was put on the villains tribe due to his behavior and gameplay in his original season. He got off on the right foot because of his strength in challenges and since he immediately found an ally in his Tocantins tribemate Tyson Apostol. He was often seen as entertainment to the tribe, inviting the tribe to meditation sessions as well as climbing trees while Rob Mariano and Sandra Diaz-Twine debated whether or not he would reach the top. Coach also developed some feelings for Jerri Manthey but not much came out of it aside from building an alliance between them. At the first Tribal Council, Coach's feelings were hurt by Sandra's comments of how he was little more than a laughing stock, but after Tribal Council, Tyson comforted him and politely told him to stop wearing feathers in his hair. Coach was fine after that. Russell Hantz tried to recruit Coach in his alliance but during a Double Tribal Council on Day 15, Coach helped Rob in the split vote against Russell and Parvati Shallow. However the plan did not work thanks to Tyson switching his vote and Tyson was eliminated. The Villains would lose the next Immunity Challenge and despite Rob and Russell's alliances targeting Russell and Rob respectively, Coach insisted in voting off the weakest player, which in his perspective was Courtney Yates. At the next Tribal Council, Coach mentioned how Tyson bridged the divisions on this tribe. He would vote for Courtney, indirectly causing Rob to be voted out. Seeking revenge for Rob's elimination, Sandra told Russell that Coach was targeting him in an attempt to keep herself and Courtney in the game longer. Russell, Parvati, and Danielle went back and forth on whether to vote out Coach or Courtney, and the girls of the tribe (minus Jerri) voted out Coach, making him the 1st member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Coach praised Parvati's game play, called Russell a little man and told him that he would have been the strongest person in the game had he admitted he crossed a line, called Sandra a coattail rider, and criticized her for her weakness in challenges. He voted for Parvati to win along with the other Villains excluding Courtney, although Sandra became the Sole Survivor in a 6-3-0 vote.	7	0	12	5	6	4	21	0.33
5	Tom Westman	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Westman	2	Tom was assigned to the Heroes tribe due to his popularity in Palau. When the Heroes lost the seasons first Immunity Challenge, Tom joined the rest of the tribe in unanimously voting out Sugar Kiper. Following her elimination, Tom found himself on the outs along with Colby Donaldson, and his fellow Palau castmate Stephenie. When Heroes lost immunity again, the trio tried to convince Cirie Fields, and Candice Cody to vote out Amanda Kimmel. At Tribal Council, Tom, Stephenie, and Colby voted for Amanda, but the rest voted for Stephenie, resulting in her elimination.\n\nOn Day 10, Tom found a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol in the jar of beans, but after J.T. Thomas read the clue out loud the majority of the tribe started searching for the idol. Tom found it, but he was caught by Amanda. When the Heroes lost the subsequent Immunity Challenge, the alliance of JT, Amanda, James Clement, Candice, Cirie, and Rupert Boneham planned to split the votes between Tom and Colby in case Tom played his idol. Tom tried to convince Amanda, James, and JT to voted out Candice, but Cirie convinced them to stick to the plan. Tom later told JT that they could use his idol and his (JT's) vote to blindside Cirie. At Tribal Council, JT flipped his vote to Cirie and Tom played his idol negating the three votes cast against him, and Cirie was blindsided.\n\nThe Heroes lost immunity again on Day 14. JT and Candice considered getting rid of James due to his injured leg which made him a liability. JT told Tom he was safe. However, at Tribal Council, JT and Candice remained loyal to their alliance so, Tom was voted out in a 5-2 vote with only Colby voting with him. He was the first of the four previous winners to get voted out, and the only previous winner not to make it to the merge and jury stages.	2	1	16	8	7	3.4	14	0.14
4	Cirie Fields	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Cirie_Fields	4	Due to her heroic gameplay, relatable backstory, and general likability, Cirie was placed on the Heroes tribe. Cirie was on good terms with most of the Heroes on the tribe right off the bat, immediately reconnecting with Micronesia allies Amanda Kimmel and James Clement. After the Heroes lost the first Immunity Challenge on Day 3, despite several people bringing up voting out Sugar Kiper, Cirie felt that Stephenie LaGrossa and Tom Westman were threats. At the first Tribal Council, however, Cirie eventually sided with the rest of the tribe and voted out Sugar.\n\nCirie would later form strong bonds with Amanda and James, as well as J.T. Thomas, Rupert Boneham, and to a lesser extent, Candice Woodcock. When the Heroes lost again on Day 6, Stephenie and Tom approached Cirie and Candice about voting Amanda out. However, the two stuck with the majority at Tribal Council and voted Stephenie out. On Day 8, J.T. attempted to stir the pot within his alliance, telling Amanda and Cirie that Candice did not trust Cirie, worrying the alliance. However, this did not matter as the Heroes finally won their first Immunity Challenge later that day.\n\nAfter the Heroes lost immunity again on Day 11, J.T. continued his double-dealing Cirie, conspiring with Tom and Colby Donaldson to target Candice, managing to convince Amanda to go with the plan. However, once Amanda relayed the plan to the rest of the Heroes Alliance, sans J.T., Cirie was able to convince them that this move would not be in their best interest, and the alliance agreed to split their votes between Colby and Tom. However, J.T. overheard the conversation and, fearing that he had lost control of the alliance, reported their plan to Colby and Tom, suggesting that they target Cirie. At Tribal Council, the alliance split their votes as planned. However, J.T. reneged on the plan and voted for Cirie along with Colby and Tom. Tom played his Hidden Immunity Idol, negating the alliance's three votes against him, and, with Colby, J.T., and Tom's votes, Cirie was blindsided 3-2-0, finishing in 17th place.	2	0	17	8	9	1.8	11	0.18
19	Parvati Shallow	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Parvati_Shallow	4	Following her notoriety in Micronesia, Parvati returned in Heroes vs. Villains as a member of the Villains tribe and with one of the biggest targets, forcing her to make an uneasy alliance with Russell Hantz. After a hasty move by Tyson Apostol—who was a member of the majority alliance—Parvati and Russell slowly took control of the Villains tribe and eventually made the merge, where Parvati masterminded a well-coordinated scheme to outplay and wipe out the Heroes. While already established as a strategist and a social player, Parvati also proved to be a formidable physical player by dominating in challenges. Parvati made it to the Final Tribal Council along with Russell and Sandra Diaz-Twine, where she was equally lauded her survival despite insurmountable odds and chastised for aligning herself to Russell, who had a hostile relationship with most of the Jury. In the end, Parvati received three votes to win but ultimately lost to Sandra.	11	3	2	8	9	2.9	39	0.28
11	J.T. Thomas	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/J.T._Thomas	3	J.T. was assigned to the Heroes tribe due to being beloved in Tocantins. It was here that the farmer employed a far different strategy than his original season, creating conflicting deals with James Clement and Tom Westman. In the opening days of the competition, he was relatively comfortable within the tribe and nobody had begun to notice his intentions. Most of the tribe began to see him as their leader and tried to remain on his good side.\n\nJust as it seemed that their rivals had the upper hand, after losing two consecutive Immunity Challenges, where Sugar Kiper and Stephenie LaGrossa were voted off the Heroes bounced back and won immunity. However, their luck ran out when they lost the next three Immunity Challenges, where Cirie Fields, Tom Westman, and James Clement were voted off. The now five-some were a force to be reckoned with and decided together that, after finding the Hidden Immunity Idol clue after winning a Reward Challenge, they would find the Idol together and use it to enable them to become the final five. J.T. upon returning to camp went looking for it alone and was caught by Amanda Kimmel, forcing him to reveal his find to the rest of the tribe. Some time later on, the Heroes began noticing that the men from the Villains were being systematically voted out, alluding to an all-female alliance. J.T. led his Heroes to the belief that if they were to give the idol to Russell Hantz and use it, they'll merge with a Villain on their side and still keep their final five deal.\n\nJ.T. wrote a note, wrapped it with the Hidden Immunity Idol and during the Immunity Challenge he handed it to Russell. When the tribes eventually merged, Russell stayed with the Villains and J.T. was blindsided after two idols were played at the first post-merge Tribal Council. He was the second of the four previous winners to get voted out, and only previous winner to get voted out after the merge.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, J.T. asked Russell whether he considered the jury votes while he was playing the game and told him getting to the end is only half of the game, and that the other half is getting the jury to vote for you, and he asked Parvati and Sandra Diaz-Twine to explain their own games. He gave his jury vote to Sandra who won 6-3-0 vote, and became the first two-time winner in Survivor history.\n\nDuring the Live Reunion Show, Russell showed everyone the letter he got from J.T. when he gave Russell the idol; in response, J.T. tried to burn the letter in a fire set up in front of the castaways and the audience, but Russell managed to retrieve it, and he won the award for the "Dumbest Move in Survivor History" for giving up his idol to Russell.	7	1	10	7	5	2.8	27	0.26
13	Candice Woodcock	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Candice_Woodcock	3	A controversial inclusion on the cast, Candice entered the season on the Heroes tribe, due to her having chosen to nobly Mutiny from her tribe to join her former allies. Though Candice did not form many social connections in the early days of the game, she was eventually recruited as a number into the majority Heroes Alliance, which opposed a minority group led by Tom Westman; who tried multiple times to pull Candice to his side.\n\nBy the time the majority of Tom's alliance had been eliminated, several of Candice's tribemates (most notably Amanda Kimmel) had begun to view her as unreliable for entertaining Tom's pleas, and planned to vote her out ahead of the Day 15 Double Tribal Council. Luckily for Candice, she managed to win the Heroes' Individual Immunity, saving herself from elimination. The Heroes went on to win the remaining tribal Immunity Challenges, keeping Candice safe until the merge.\n\nWhen the Heroes and Villains merged into Yin Yang, Candice initially remained committed to her original Heroes Alliance. However, they were soon put into a 5-4 minority following a double Hidden Immunity Idol play from Parvati Shallow on Day 27. In the aftermath of this vote, Russell Hantz approached Candice about defecting to the Villains, which she agreed to consider. Ahead of the next vote, Candice consulted with Sandra Diaz-Twine; who was considering joining the remaining Heroes to vote out Russell. In the end though, both women voted with the Villains, helping to eliminate Amanda in a 6-3 vote.\n\nUpon returning to camp, both Rupert Boneham and Colby Donaldson lambasted Candice for her betrayal, though she was largely unbothered, feeling secure in her position amongst the Villains. After Russell misplayed a Hidden Immunity Idol at the previous Tribal Council, Candice helped the Villains in their search for the re-hidden idol. Though the idol was found by Sandra, Rupert managed to convince the tribe that he had found it instead. After the Immunity Challenge, the original Villains planned to split the votes between Rupert and Colby, but Jerri Manthey pushed to have the vote split between Rupert and Candice instead, viewing the latter as a larger threat.\n\nAt Tribal Council, Candice joined the Villains in splitting the vote 3-3, unaware that she was the recipient of the three other votes instead of Colby. In a surprising turn of events, both Rupert and Colby voted for Candice as revenge for her betrayal of Amanda. This, combined with the three other votes from the split vote was enough to blindside and eliminate Candice 5-3. She became the fifth member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Candice criticized Russell for his duplicitous gameplay and likened Parvati's alliance with him to that of an abusive relationship. Candice would eventually vote for Sandra to win, alongside all the other Hero jury members and Courtney Yates.	8	0	8	5	6	1	31	0.26
12	Amanda Kimmel	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Amanda_Kimmel	3	Amanda was a member of the majority alliance on the Heroes tribe consisting of herself, Cirie Fields, James Clement, J.T. Thomas, and Rupert Boneham, putting Candice Woodcock, Colby Donaldson, Stephenie LaGrossa, Sugar Kiper, and Tom Westman on the outside (although Colby, Stephenie, and Tom were in an alliance, Candice and Sugar found themselves in the middle). However, Colby, Stephenie, and Tom were spared after the Heroes lost the first Immunity Challenge when the tribe mutually agreed that the much weaker and more annoying Sugar should leave, and was unanimously voted out.\n\nAt their next Immunity Challenge loss, Stephenie was immediately blamed for the loss by James, who viewed her as a bit of an omen due to her losing streak in Palau. The alliance of Colby, Stephenie, and Tom tried to pull Candice and Cirie into their voting bloc against Amanda. However, after a heated Tribal Council, the two women voted out Stephenie, further putting Colby and Tom on the outs.\n\nThe Heroes enjoyed an immunity win in the third round, but after another loss, Colby and Tom were targeted once again. Tom had found a Hidden Immunity Idol after the loss, so Amanda and the majority agreed to split their votes between Colby and Tom, so that if Tom played the idol, Colby would go. Unknowingly, J.T. flipped and helped to take out Cirie.\n\nAmanda's alliance maintained their majority, voting out Tom at the next Tribal Council. At the Double Tribal Council, the Heroes unanimously voted out James due to a knee injury he sustained at a previous challenge, saving Colby to be a new member of the alliance.\n\nThe Heroes would win the next three Immunity Challenges and make the merge. The Heroes targeted Jerri Manthey, but Amanda told former Micronesia Parvati Shallow that the Heroes were targeting her, although Parvati did not believe it (Parvati had told Amanda about her Hidden Immunity Idol in exchange to know the Heroes target). Parvati shocked everyone by playing idols on both Jerri and Sandra Diaz-Twine, causing all of the Heroes' votes to be nullified and causing J.T. to be unanimously voted out.\n\nAmanda, Colby, and Danielle DiLorenzo won a Reward Challenge the next round and got to watch Treasure Island in the former home of Robert Louis Stevenson. Danielle found a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol in the popcorn bowl but was caught by Amanda while trying to hide it. Amanda grabbed the clue out of her hand causing a fight between the two women over who should have the clue. Colby intervened and stated that Danielle should keep the clue since she found it, resulting in Amanda being annoyed with Colby for not sticking up for her. At Tribal Council, Amanda was voted out 6-3 when Candice flipped over to the Villains to h vote her out after being persuaded by Russell Hantz.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Amanda voted for Sandra, who would end up winning a second time.	8	0	9	7	8	2.1	30	0.27
16	Colby Donaldson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Colby_Donaldson	3	Colby initially became an alliance outsider, along with ex-Palau players Tom Westman and Stephenie LaGrossa. Together with the stress of the competition, he had a surprisingly weak performance in challenges, with James Clement (who visibly idolized him) even calling him, "Superman in a fatsuit." After losing three Immunity Challenges Colby was the only member of his alliance remaining. Despite being an outsider, he and the rest of the Heroes won the next three Immunity Challenges, securing that the Heroes and the Villains would enter the merge with five members each. But after a bold move done by Villain Parvati Shallow of giving two Hidden Immunity Idols to Sandra Diaz-Twine and Jerri Manthey (Colby's Outback nemesis), the Heroes were put in the minority and were systematically eliminated, one by one. After fellow former Hero Candice Woodcock voted along with the former Villains to vote out Amanda Kimmel, he claimed that he and Rupert Boneham were the only remaining Heroes. Fortunately, Colby and Rupert managed to survive the following two Tribal Council's when they voted out Candice for her betrayal and then with Russell Hantz and Jerri's help voted out Danielle DiLorenzo when Russell realized that Parvati and Danielle's true loyalty was to each other. After losing the Final 5 Immunity Challenge, Colby ultimately gave up and conceded to the remaining Villains. However, a short time later, Colby attempted to strategize with Russell to vote out Sandra, but Russell criticized Colby for giving up and then attempting to make a move. Colby was the last of the Heroes to be voted out, being voted out on Day 37, as everyone believed he would be a jury threat.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Colby viewed Russell as "delusional" for saying he had no luck in getting to the Final Tribal Council and felt that Parvati was riding Russell's coattails. He voted for the more heroic Sandra to be the first two-time winner, in which she won in a 6-3-0 vote.	8	0	5	6	5	1.7	37	0.22
17	Jerri Manthey	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jerri_Manthey	3	Jerri's notoriety earned her a spot on the Villains tribe. Jerri initially had a special friendship with fellow Villain Coach Wade, with their tribemates often teasing them about the "Dragon Slayer" and the "Black Widow" being lovers. At first, Jerri was aligned with Coach, Courtney Yates, Rob Mariano, Sandra Diaz-Twine, and Tyson Apostol, and played a part in the split vote during the Double Tribal Council on Day 15, but eventually she became, a focal point to Russell Hantz' rise to power over the Villains tribe by helping his alliance, comprising of outsiders Parvati Shallow, whom Jerri heavily disliked, and Danielle DiLorenzo, to vote out Russell's archenemy Rob.\n\nAt the first post-merge vote, the Heroes and Villains were tied at 5-5. Parvati, who had two Hidden Immunity Idols (she found one and was given another one from Russell, who got it from J.T. Thomas following the last tribal Immunity Challenge), used an idol on Sandra, and in order to "sweeten their odds", gave one to Jerri as well. All the Heroes voted for Jerri, but because of the Hidden Immunity Idol, all votes cast against her were negated. This eventually became the subsequent downfall of the Heroes. She eventually won one Reward Challenge and one Immunity Challenge (much to her delight, as it was her first immunity win). When Russell wanted to get rid of Danielle for being too close to Parvati on Day 33, Jerri once again became a pivotal swing vote and played a part in Danielle's elimination after Danielle unintentionally revealed that Jerri was never part of their alliance. Russell feared that Jerri might win because of her popularity (and stipulated that the final four was also comprised of Parvati and Sandra, both of whom are former winners). Russell also deemed that even if he voted her out, she would still vote for him at the Final Tribal Council. This theory seemed to be correct during Jerri's post elimination confessional, but soon turned turned out to be wrong when Parvati revealed Russell's true reason for voting out Jerri, who was appalled by this thought and his behavior towards the jurors at the Final Tribal Council. She cast her vote for Parvati, who lost to Sandra, who became the first two-time winner in Survivor history.	10	1	4	7	8	1.5	38	0.26
3	Randy Bailey	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Randy_Bailey	2	Randy was put on the Villains tribe for being memorable for hating everyone and anyone he met. Randy was considered the weakest member of his tribe due to him being the oldest of the tribe. This weakness was seen in the Day 1 Reward Challenge against J.T. Thomas, and in the Day 8 combined Reward/Immunity Challenge against James Clement. Initially skeptical about the possibility of creating fire without flint, Randy was in awe when Rob Mariano managed to do exactly that.\n\nDespite Randy's physical setbacks, he found a notable amount of food for his tribe, although it was not appreciated by many, to his dismay. Facing their first Tribal Council on Day 8, Randy campaigned for the elimination of former winner Parvati Shallow, who he viewed as dangerous and had the most relationships among the cast. In the end, Randy's lobbying failed and he was eliminated in a unanimous vote. It seemed likely that Randy knew he was leaving since he didn't even bother to vote Parvati and claimed in his last words that he knew his message fell on deaf ears. Before leaving, a furious Randy threw his buff at the fire pit, becoming the first person to do that.	2	0	18	4	6	1.7	8	0.25
8	Rob Mariano	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rob_Mariano	5	Assigned to the Villains tribe following his All-Stars appearance, Rob quickly became the de facto leader and helped his tribe achieve success, building fire without the aid of a flint by making a fire saw, and won the first Immunity Challenge for the Villains, thanks to his superb puzzle-solving skills.\n\nThe next day, as Rob was infuriated by his tribe's poor work ethic, he walked to the woods and collapsed later. Tribemate Jerri Manthey found him unconscious in the jungle, prompting the Survivor medical team to intervene. When the medics found nothing to worry about, they cleared him to continue competing. Rob then led the Villains to another victory, winning them their second straight challenge. Despite his strong work ethic and popularity within the tribe, he gained an enemy in newcomer Russell Hantz.\n\nRob then formed the majority alliance of six on the Villains, that was up against Russell's alliance of himself, Parvati Shallow, and Danielle DiLorenzo.\n\nAt the Day 15 Double Tribal Council, Rob won individual immunity. His alliance planned to split the votes 3-3 against Russell and Parvati, and if someone played the Hidden Immunity Idol then the votes wouldn't count, and then a re-vote would occur and his alliance would vote out the non-protected player. However, Russell persuaded Tyson Apostol to switch his vote to Parvati, and Russell played his idol on her, thus eliminating Tyson, Rob's closest ally.\n\nDespite still having the numbers in the tribe, Rob's alliance began to crumble. When Jerri switched sides to Russell's alliance and Coach Wade insisted on voting off the tribe's weakest link Courtney Yates, Rob was voted out 4-3-1.\n\nAt the Reunion, the feud between Russell and Rob was mentioned and would later be settled a year later in Survivor: Redemption Island.	8	0	13	8	9	2.9	18	0.44

11	Brenda Lowe	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Brenda_Lowe	2	Brenda began the season on the younger La Flor tribe. In the first few minutes of the game, Brenda found the Medallion of Power, which La Flor exchanged for fishing supplies. At camp, Brenda became close friends with Chase Rice, but eventually learned that he had made an alliance with Shannon Elkins. This made Brenda target Shannon, who in turn targeted her. Following La Flor's first Immunity Challenge loss on Day 6, NaOnka Mixon recruited Brenda to join her alliance with Sash Lenahan and vote out Shannon. Brenda agreed to the alliance, and also added Kelly Shinn into their group.\n\nWith four guaranteed votes for Shannon, Brenda hoped to get Chase to join her alliance and give them a possible majority. Though reluctant at first, Shannon's outburst at Tribal Council swayed Chase to vote with Brenda's alliance, sending Shannon home. With Chase now on her side, Brenda's alliance assumed control of the La Flor tribe, targeting Shannon's allies Alina Wilson and Kelly Bruno. However, La Flor won the following two Immunity Challenges, putting Brenda's plans on hold. In the meantime, she strengthened her alliance with NaOnka, who shared the clue to the tribe's Hidden Immunity Idol with her. The two eventually found the idol near Tree Mail, with Brenda allowing NaOnka to keep it for herself.\n\nAt the tribe switch on Day 12, Brenda remained on La Flor along with most of her alliance. She, along with the other younger members of the tribe, quickly bonded with Jane Bright, who warned Brenda about Marty Piombo's control of the original Espada tribe. Seeing Marty as a threat, Brenda and Sash decided to have their alliance split their votes between Marty and his ally, Jill Behm, in case either of them used Espada's idol during the Double Tribal Council on Day 15.\n\nHowever, Jill won individual immunity at the challenge, forcing Brenda's alliance to split their votes between Marty and original La Flor outsider Kelly B., whose prosthetic leg was deemed by Brenda as too threatening should she make the Final Tribal Council. Despite initially planning to eliminate Marty, Kelly B. was ultimately viewed as too dangerous to continue and Brenda's alliance voted her out on the revote. Despite this minor setback, Brenda and her allies successfully eliminated Jill on Day 18, after Sash convinced Marty to give him his idol in exchange for safety from the vote.\n\nBrenda was among the contestants to make it to the merge on Day 19, joining the new Libertad tribe. Brenda's original alliance reassembled and proceeded to vote out Alina and Marty. Recognizing Brenda's growing control over the game, Holly Hoffman decided to campaign for her elimination on Day 25. She successfully recruited most of the tribe, including Brenda's ally NaOnka to her side. Holly also attempted to get Chase to assist them as well, but he was hesitant about voting against Brenda and ended up telling her of Holly's plan.\n\nDespite Chase's revelation, Brenda remained confident in her safety, believing that Sash would use his idol to save her if she was truly in danger of being voted out. However, prior to Tribal Council, NaOnka advised Sash against this and warned him of the repercussions of doing so. Thus at Tribal Council, Sash did not use his idol on Brenda and she was voted out in an 8-1-1 vote, becoming the third member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Brenda stated that she was proud of the finalists, but criticized Sash for breaking the alliance that they had. She then chastised Chase for easily accepting the fact she was going to be eliminated, despite the bond they shared. In the end, though, Brenda voted for Chase to be the Sole Survivor.	7	0	10	8	9	2.7	27	0.26

17	Phillip Sheppard	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Phillip_Sheppard	2	Phillip rubbed his tribe the wrong way from day one, with his tribe not taking kindly to his bossy attitude and outrageous statements. They were also skeptical of his background as a former federal agent. After Ometepe lost the first Immunity Challenge, he was approached by Kristina Kell and Francesca Hogi to work together to get rid of a member of the large Rob Mariano-led alliance, most likely Natalie Tenerelli, who was viewed as one of the weaker players. However, at Tribal Council, Phillip worked self-defensively and called out Kristina and Francesca's (i.e. mispronouncing her name several times despite corrections) Hidden Immunity Idol. In a confessional, Phillip revealed that he had been acting like an annoying, controversial contestant intentionally as part of a well-hidden strategy to make his tribemates believe that he is the perfect person to bring to the final three.\n\nAfter losing yet another Immunity Challenge, Phillip approached Rob and told him he "owned his vote". Rather than risk Phillip opening his mouth at Tribal Council again, Rob simply put his hand on Kristina's shoulder before he voted, indicating that he wanted Phillip to vote for her. Out of fear, Kristina decided to play the idol, not knowing Rob swerved the vote toward Matt Elrod's direction instead. Despite annoying his tribemates with his dictatorial approach, outbursts and odd comments, Phillip lasted through the merge at Boston Rob's expense. \n\nAfter the merge, his peculiarities continued to be a constant source of discourse with the former Zapatera members. While Ometepe had the numbers advantage, the Zapateras outwardly showed their disdain for Phillip. When Steve Wright finally snapped and called him "crazy", Phillip lashed out, stating that Wright was subconsciously implying him the derogatory "N" word. This gesture sparked controversy around camp, where Phillip's alliance partners rallied to Steve's defense and let Phillip know that he was overreacting. That afternoon before Tribal Council, Julie jokingly stole Phillip's shorts, much to his dismay. At the next Tribal Council, the heated discussion between Steve and Phillip was a main topic of discussion. After admitting she stole the garment, Julie faced the wrath of Ometepe, voting her out. While leaving Tribal Council, Julie told Phillip that he'll never know where his shorts are. The next day, Phillip miraculously found his shorts under a rock, wearing them to the duel to surprise her. As predicted, the remaining Zapatera members, Ralph Kiser and Steve, were subsequently voted out, forcing the six Ometepes to turn on each other.\n\nWhen Andrea Boehlke returned from Redemption Island, she zeroed in on Phillip as being the next to go. Rob got wind of the plot and managed to convince the tribe to vote for Andrea instead. Phillip managed to make it to the final three along with Rob and Natalie. During the Final Tribal Council, he was lambasted for his strange behavior and odd comments. The only person that voted for Phillip was Ralph, the only jury member who seems to have a liking for Phillip (on account of Phillip saying that Ralph was the hardest worker of the Zapateras), which apparently was mutual. This one vote landed him sole possession of second place ahead of Natalie Tenerelli who received 0 votes, losing to Rob by seven votes (8-1-0). Despite the single vote, Phillip is regarded by many as the biggest and most obvious finals goat in Survivor history.\n\nAt the live Reunion Show, Jeff Probst introduced a special guest - a certified federal agent named Diane Hardy. She revealed that Phillip was indeed a former federal agent.	4	0	2	3	7	2.93	39	0.10

14	Andrea Boehlke	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Andrea_Boehlke	3	Andrea started the game on the Ometepe tribe, which received Rob Mariano as a member on Day 1 to complete the tribe. Andrea found herself as a part of his alliance, along with Natalie Tenerelli, Grant Mattos, Ashley Underwood, and Matt Elrod, outnumbering the rival alliance of Kristina Kell, Francesca Hogi, and Phillip Sheppard. Her three closest allies and friends throughout the game would be Matt (who she had a heavily flirtatious relationship with), Grant, and Rob. Ometepe got off to a bad start, losing three out of the first four Immunity Challenges (and in that stretch, the only victory came as a result of Zapatera throwing the challenge so they could go to Tribal Council to eliminate Russell Hantz). Andrea's role in the alliance was as a vote against Kristina for splitting the votes since Kristina found the Hidden Immunity Idol early on in the game. However, Rob started to lose trust in Andrea when noticing she and Matt were becoming closer to each other than with himself, even comparing them to himself and Amber Brkich from All-Stars. So on Day 5, Rob went behind Andrea's back to blindside Matt, when Andrea thought the plan was to split the votes between Kristina and Phillip. Andrea was upset when Matt was sent to Redemption Island but she remained in Rob's alliance, which now included Phillip.\n\nOn Day 21, Matt returned to the game and the tribes merged, which meant Andrea was in the majority 7-5. However, Mike Chiesl became friends with Matt and Andrea and asked them to side with the Zapatera tribe, even offered to take them to the end instead of his former tribemates. Andrea considered it but once Matt told Rob about considering voting him off, Andrea felt that aligning with Matt could get her in trouble so she voted him off along with the rest of former Ometepe, sending Matt back to Redemption Island on Day 21.\n\nAndrea would be in a good spot for the next several votes, in which she won an individual Immunity Challenge on Day 24. However, she was slowly finding her way down to the bottom of the Ometepe alliance, with her being the hardest working of the Ometepe girls, her relationship with possible Redemption Island returnee Matt, alliance leader Rob having a much closer personal bond with both Grant and Natalie, with Natalie and Ashley's stronger friendship, and all others (particularly Rob) hoping to take the game's two most obvious jury goats Natalie and Phillip to the Final Tribal Council with them. Once all the Zapatera members were voted off, Andrea thought the next to go would be Phillip since he originally belonged to Kristina's alliance. However, on Day 32, Andrea would be unanimously voted off since she was seen as a threat, her two closest remaining allies Grant and Rob being the main ones to determine she should be eliminated over Phillip. When she arrived at Redemption Island, she got the cold shoulder from everyone, with Matt being angry with her resulting in an argument and Ralph Kiser refusing to let her in the shelter.\n\nOn Redemption Island Arena, despite facing tough opposition with the three biggest physical and jury threats Grant (who would be Rob's next blindside victim), Matt, and Mike, Andrea shocked most and won both of the duels she participated in, including the "winner takes all" final four-person duel, and re-entered the game on Day 36. Andrea was glad to be back in the game, but she felt nervous because she was voted off once already, and obviously being on the bottom rung of the Ometepe alliance and a threat it could easily happen again. Andrea started off pushing for an all-girls Final Three alliance, and began her campaigning to get either Phillip or Rob voted off, by making up a complete lie that Matt, Mike, and Ralph had all said they would vote for Phillip should he reach the Final Tribal Council. Unbeknownst to her though, both Natalie and Ashley knew about Rob having a Hidden Immunity Idol that he was almost certain to play at his final opportunity at the upcoming Tribal Council, making an effort to sway them against Rob almost futile. Since Ashley had recently won an individual Immunity Challenge and was growing very close to Natalie, Rob planned on sparing Andrea should Ashley lose the Immunity Challenge on Day 37. However, Ashley won immunity, with Andrea a close second, putting Andrea in the hot seat. Andrea did everything she could to convince the girls and Phillip that they needed to make a big move and vote Rob off since he's a major threat to win if he makes it to the end, and informing Ashley, Natalie, and Phillip that they were seen as mere pawns of Rob's who at that point had little respect from the jury members she had encountered while on Redemption Island. However, at Tribal Council, the girls and Phillip maintained their loyalty to Rob, and even if they had flipped, Rob did play his Hidden Immunity Idol just in case so Andrea would be voted out of the game for good with a 4-0 vote, finishing in 5th place.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Andrea was unimpressed by Natalie's game, deeming her betrayal of best friend Ashley in favor of Rob at the final four Tribal Council as weak coattail riding, and calling her relationship with Rob creepy. Andrea told Phillip that she never knew the real one at all, which he noted was because of not being in the original alliance. Although Andrea did not like Rob's gameplay on a personal level, she recognized that Rob played a very strong game overall and voted for Rob to win the title of Sole Survivor.	7	0	5	7	8	1.71	37	0.19

18	Rob Mariano	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rob_Mariano	5	Contrary to the reception of the Zapatera tribe to Russell Hantz, Rob was warmly received by his Ometepe tribe. It didn't take him long to be accepted into an alliance, which consisted of Andrea Boehlke, Matt Elrod, Grant Mattos, Natalie Tenerelli, and Ashley Underwood. His first target was Kristina Kell, who was looking for the Hidden Immunity Idol. They decided to split the vote between Kristina and Francesca Hogi when Ometepe lost the first Immunity Challenge. At that Tribal Council, Rob saw an opportunity to manipulate Phillip Sheppard, who was a loose cannon. Phillip's vote would break the tie and send Francesca to Redemption Island. When Ometepe lost the second Immunity Challenge, Rob made a deal with Phillip that he would protect him and welcome him into the Ometepe alliance if he followed the plan and acted as if he was getting voted out, but he told Phillip that he was not going home. Rob and the Ometepe alliance then blindsided Matt, a member of their own alliance. They did this because they feared Andrea and Matt would develop into a power couple, very much like Rob and Amber did in Survivor: All-Stars. After Ometepe won the third challenge, they then voted out Kristina, but split the vote with Phillip, just in case she had the idol. Rob then found his own idol when he lied that he had bowel problems and went to look for it. Ometepe then won the remaining Immunity Challenges left until the merge, turning an 8 to 6 disadvantage into a 6-5 advantage pending the result of the final duel.\n\nWhen Matt re-entered the game as a result of Redemption Island, he decided to keep with Rob despite considering flipping. He was honest in telling Rob he was initially considering flipping on their alliance, which prompted Rob to turn his other allies on Matt, thus sending him back to Redemption Island. The Ometepe alliance then started their Pagonging of the Zapatera tribe, voting off Mike Chiesl, David Murphy, Julie Wolfe, Ralph Kiser, and Steve Wright. During this period, Zapatera tried to target either Rob or Phillip unsuccessfully, with only a few instances of his allies briefly straying from his "Buddy System" strategy. It would be that strategy that caused Natalie to alert Rob that Ashley was considering working with some Zapatera members, which solidified that Rob's optimal endgame scenario would involve Phillip and Natalie.\n\nAfter Steve was voted out, there was nowhere left to hide, and the Ometepe alliance was forced to turn on themselves. Rob continued to be in control, and he convinced everybody to vote off Andrea instead of Phillip, who he conspired to take to the Final Three with because of his unpopularity with the jury members. Ashley was Rob's next intended target due to her previous albeit minor betrayal of trust as well as her closeness to Natalie. This plan was halted when Ashley won the Immunity Challenge. Rob was forced to eliminate his good friend in the game, Grant, due to his superior strength in challenges to Natalie. Andrea then came back into the game via Redemption Island and was then voted off again by Rob, Phillip, Natalie, and Ashley, who was starting to open her eyes to Rob's gameplay. Rob played his idol as it was the last chance to do so, negating Andrea's vote and forcing Ashley and Natalie to vote for Andrea. Rob had destroyed all other clues or evidence to other idols in the game. Rob then won immunity from the second-to-last Tribal Council, and thus won a spot in the Final Three. Rob then decided to take Phillip and Natalie to the Final Three with him. He believed he could win against them because Phillip was disliked by the jury especially by the Zapatera members, and Natalie had done nothing in the game and around camp, and had just been one of his minions. Ashley, realizing that she was going to get voted off, tried to convince Natalie to vote for Phillip, forcing a tie, but Natalie stayed loyal to Rob, consequently voting off Ashley.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Rob delivered his argument to why he should be the Sole Survivor, which was much more developed than Phillip's or Natalie's, which were both very weak. However, he was criticized for being cutthroat and a cult leader, and his potentially creepy relationship with Natalie. Rob raised the stakes by saying that regardless of tonight's result, this would be his last day on Survivor. David lobbied for Rob to get the votes needed to win, citing Rob's gameplay this season as one of the best in Survivor history. Rob then won an easy victory, mastering his strategy and finally becoming the Sole Survivor, only losing Ralph's vote to Phillip, as Phillip said earlier that Ralph was Zapatera's hardest worker. Rob won by an 8-1-0 margin.	8	1	1	8	9	6.93	39	0.21

1	Francesca Hogi	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Francesca_Hogi	2	Francesca was placed on the Ometepe tribe at the start of the season. Upon revealing Survivor supervillains Rob Mariano and Russell Hantz as players on Day 1, Francesca immediately expressed her distaste, outright stating that they were "troublemakers". At camp, Francesca initially made an alliance with Phillip Sheppard and Kristina Kell, the latter of whom found the Hidden Immunity Idol. However, early cracks in the alliance began to form when Francesca grew annoyed with Phillip's talkative personality.\n\nAfter Ometepe's loss at the inaugural Immunity Challenge, Natalie Tenerelli became Francesca's alliance first target for elimination. However at Tribal Council, Phillip went double-agent by telling Rob about Kristina's idol, putting Kristina and Francesca in particular trouble. Despite Kristina being deemed as untrustworthy, it was Francesca who got eliminated from Ometepe in a 4-3-2 Split Vote.\n\nUpon her elimination, she was sent to Redemption Island, where she received meager supplies and food, waiting for her opponent in the upcoming Redemption Island duel. The opponent turned out to be fellow Ometepe tribemate Matt Elrod, much to Francesca's shock. At the first duel, Francesca initially gained an early lead, but Matt managed to catch up, winning the duel. Francesca congratulated Matt told him to get revenge on Ometepe. With this, Francesca was the first player permanently eliminated from the game.	0	0	18	5	6	4	6	0.00
2	Russell Hantz	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Russell_Hantz	4	Russell returned to compete for a third time along with Heroes vs. Villains archrival Rob Mariano to settle their iconic rivalry. After a draw of buffs, Russell went to the purple Zapatera tribe, who visibly resented his inclusion to the tribe because of their full knowledge of his previous gameplay. When the tribe arrived at camp, Russell stated he would be playing differently than his previous seasons and he would not do the things he was notorious for in the past, though his tribemates remained suspicious. Russell however led his tribe to win the first two Immunity Challenges. During this winning streak Russell recruited Stephanie Valencia and Krista Klumpp, the only two who were open to work with him.\n\nThe three found the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol and began searching, not knowing their attempts were futile because Ralph Kiser already found the idol. Russell was then called out by Ralph for stealing the clue which angered the former. With no idol to protect him, Russell feigned possessing one, telling Stephanie to hold on her bag suspiciously the whole day so it would look like she was "protecting" the idol.\n\nHungry for Russell's downfall, the six other tribe members formed their own alliance and planned to throw the Day 8 Immunity Challenge to eliminate Russell. They informed Russell that Francesca Hogi won the first duel (which in truth Matt Elrod won) to throw Russell off-guard, only to split the votes between him and Stephanie. Zapatera did lose the Immunity Challenge with Russell surmising that he was set up. Russell got wind of the plan and attempted to coerce Julie Wolfe to vote with them with Russell reiterating he was a changed man. At Tribal Council however, Russell's plea to Julie was to no avail as she remained with the majority, forcing the game's first three-way tie. In the revote, the majority alliance unanimously voted Russell out, 5-1. Furious, Russell headed for Redemption Island, swearing to come back. Russell further realized his tribe's treachery upon learning that Matt had won the last duel and not Francesca.\n\nRussell vowed to defeat Matt. However, in a surprise turn of events, the supervillain finally fell from grace after being defeated in the following duel on Day 10, which officially eliminated Russell. Much to the spectators' surprise, Russell started crying after losing, stating he had really changed and was not given the opportunity to show it. Russell congratulated Matt for defeating him and left the Redemption Island Arena. During his final words statement, Russell stated that he would never play again because he felt he had nothing else to prove to himself and his family. However, at the Reunion Show, he told Jeff Probst to "keep his number" for a future season.	2	0	17	6	4	4	10	0.20

17	Coach Wade	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Coach_Wade	3	Coach came back for a third time with fellow returning player Ozzy Lusth. After the two were randomly assigned tribes, Coach was placed on the Upolu tribe where he was not well received by his tribemates, with his only friend being Edna Ma. He had a conflict with Christine Shields Markoski after Christine had openly declared on Day 1 that Coach and Ozzy were "temporary players". Due to Christine clearly not being on the same side as him, Coach targeted her and her ally Stacey Powell first and thanks to the alliance he created on the first night (consisting of Albert Destrade, Brandon Hantz, Rick Nelson, and Sophie Clarke) and with extra help from Edna, Christine and Stacey would be the first to go from the Upolu tribe. Coach was the first player to know about Brandon being Russell Hantz's nephew, and was the only one to know until Brandon revealed it to his whole tribe in during Tribal Council on Day 10. Coach had a shaky relationship with Brandon because Brandon trusted him more than anyone else at the tribe but at the same time Brandon proved to be an unstable and oversensitive player. Coach's first big decision came on Day 17, where Coach was upset at Mikayla Wingle for not listening to him during the Immunity Challenge, which ultimately lead to their defeat. Coach, Brandon, and Edna were set on voting out Mikayla, but Albert and Sophie thought that Edna deserved to go, since she was a weaker player. Coach did all he could to convince Rick that Edna should stay because Edna would blindly follow Coach, no matter what. In the end, Coach barely got his way, and Mikayla was voted off that night.\n\nAfter Mikayla's departure, the remaining Upolu members, mainly thanks to Coach, became more unified and went into the merge ready to take down Savaii with the help of John Cochran, who respected Coach and did not really like his own tribe. At the Te Tuna tribe's first Tribal Council, Cochran decided to side against Savaii, which allowed Coach and the rest of Upolu to systematically eliminate them. By Day 28, the only Savaii members that remained were Cochran and Ozzy (the latter who had survived via Redemption Island), and voting out other people became more difficult for Coach, since everyone truly trusted him and as much as he did not want to disappoint anyone, he had to. He stuck to his word by staying true to his original alliance, voting off Cochran first and then voted out Edna.\n\nHowever, Coach and Ozzy made a deal when Coach visited Redemption Island on Day 31 as part of the Family Visit that the two would work together to go to the Final Three. Coach said that he made that promise because Ozzy is a truly noble player that he respects. Later on, Coach was annoyed that while the loved ones stayed at Redemption Island, Brandon's dad practically forced him into taking Brandon to the end and as much as he liked Brandon, he felt like he had to go. Coach was upset when Brandon won immunity, but then Brandon talked about giving immunity to Albert to forgive Albert and then Brandon, Albert, and Coach would vote out Sophie. But when Brandon gave his immunity to Albert at Tribal Council, Coach stuck to his own plans and voted out Brandon. Once Ozzy returned from Redemption Island, Coach was torn between his Upolu allies and his promise with Ozzy. Ozzy won Individual Immunity and with no choice but to turn on each other, Rick was voted out in a 3-2 vote. When Coach attempted to hug Rick, Rick angrily told him to sit down. In the final four when Sophie won immunity, Coach had one last big decision to make between voting off Albert or Ozzy. In the end, Coach made what he believed was the smarter decision and voted off Ozzy.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, most players respected Coach for playing a much better and stronger game than in his two previous seasons, but at the same time, they criticized him for preaching his honor code because he did play a deceptive game, and not owning his game. Coach received votes from Cochran, Edna, and Rick (at first thought to be from Brandon, Cochran, and Jim), which was enough to make him the runner-up of Survivor: South Pacific, behind Sole Survivor Sophie.	5	1	2	8	7	5.57	39	0.13
15	Ozzy Lusth	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ozzy_Lusth	4	Assigned to the red Savaii tribe, Ozzy lead the tribe in most camp activities and even acting as support, as evidence when he comforted Dawn Meehan when the latter went to a mild depression. While his physical prowess kept him in the tribe, his tribemates did not let him take control over the tribe, as seen during Savaii first Tribal Council, where Ozzy's plot to oust John Cochran was put on hold, when the tribe eliminated his initial ally Semhar Tadesse, who blew the Immunity Challenge for them. Few days down the line, Ozzy joined Jim Rice's proposed a "3+2" alliance made consisting of the tribe's most athletic members (Ozzy, Jim, Keith Tollefson, Whitney Duncan, and Elyse Umemoto), stating that once the remaining competition was over with, the males would secretly blindside the two females. The group delayed any of its plans, when Savaii won the Day 5 Immunity Challenge. On Day 7, Ozzy found the Hidden Immunity Idol in hopes of redeeming himself from his infamous blindside in his previous season. The next day, Savaii lost the Immunity Challenge, where Ozzy joined the rest of the tribe in voting Mark Caruso out for being the oldest person in the team.\n\nOn Day 9, Jim was worried about seeing Ozzy getting closer with Elyse since Semhar's elimination. With this, Jim plotted to avoid Ozzy from obtaining more power by plotting with the outsiders Cochran and Dawn. The plan materialized in Day 14, when Jim, Cochran, and Dawn voted against Elyse, and with Keith and Whitney played safe by voting for Dawn. Ozzy and Elyse were thrown off-guard, as the latter got blindsided.\n\nThat night, disappointed by Elyse's surprise removal, Ozzy declared himself a "free agent," removing himself from the alliance and declaring to the tribe he had the Hidden Immunity Idol; but soon patched things up with his tribe and led them to winning the next Immunity Challenge. Worried by Upolu's one-person advantage (one of their tribemates, Christine Shields Markoski was dominating the Redemption Island duels), Ozzy proposed to his tribe a risky plan he called "Trojan Horse"—should Savaii loses the next Immunity Challenge, the tribe would purposefully vote him out, effectively sending himself to Redemption Island in hopes of defeating Christine. Ozzy then surrendered his Hidden Immunity Idol to Cochran, stating that he would get it back should he return to the game. At the duel, Ozzy did defeat Christine, and re-entered the competition as part of the newly merged Te Tuna tribe, where he won the first individual Immunity Challenge along with Dawn. Anticipating a 6-6 tie vote between the former warring tribes, Ozzy gave his Hidden Immunity Idol to Whitney, stating that a Savaii member getting voted out is highly unlikely because two of them had immunity, while one other person would use the idol. Unknown to them, Cochran was pulled by the rival Upolu tribe, with the Harvard Law student spoiling Savaii's strategies and secrets. At Tribal Council, the anticipated 6-6 tie happened between Keith and Rick Nelson, forcing a revote. But not wanting to end the vote a stalemate (which would culminate in drawing rocks, where the unlucky person who would pick the colored rock would be eliminated) and the idea of playing the game based on probability, Cochran betrayed the Savaii alliance and joined Upolu in voting Keith, sending him to Redemption Island. The Savaii tribe was furious with Cochran.\n\nDefenseless and unable to win individual immunity once again, Ozzy was immediately voted out returning to Redemption Island. He began to defeat his former tribemates, including Cochran, stating that he would feed them, but defeat them anyway. He eventually re-entered the competition at the Final Five and claimed Individual Immunity.\n\nWhen the final five contestants returned at Te Tuna camp, Coach expressed his desire to bring Ozzy at the Final Tribal Council, where he would be giving his own Hidden Immunity Idol if necessary. However, Ozzy was suspicious if Coach would really do such promise. At the next Immunity Challenge, ex-Upolu member Sophie Clarke who was ahead of Ozzy, until she audaciously ordered Albert to help her win the challenge, only to be interrupted by Jeff Probst because it was a direct violation of the Survivor Rulebook. Nonetheless, Ozzy won immunity. Appalled by Sophie's actions, Ozzy blasted the economics graduate at Tribal Council for her blunt deeds and calling her a spoiled brat, causing her to become emotional. Ultimately, Coach did not fulfill his promise to Ozzy by keeping his idol unused, and eliminated Rick instead of Sophie.\n\nIn the key Final Immunity Challenge, he had the early lead but struggled with the puzzle portion and lost to Sophie (who Ozzy tried to get rid of the day before). Ozzy made a pitch to Coach to enforce a tie at Tribal Council, but failed. Ozzy was voted out for the third time, this time, permanently.\n\nAs a member of the jury, Ozzy blasted Albert Destrade, Sophie, and Coach for giving false hopes, condescending demeanor and breaking his "honor and integrity" code respectively. Eventually, Ozzy gave his vote to Sophie, claiming that she deserved it since she was the reason Ozzy was eliminated, and along with five other jury members, Sophie was crowned as Sole Survivor.\n\nAt the Reunion Show, Ozzy received the Fan Favorite Award of the season, winning himself $100,000, with Jeff Probst claiming that Ozzy obtained the highest percentage of votes since the award's inception.	12	1	4	8	7	3.43	38	0.32

11	John Cochran	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/John_Cochran	2	Believing that host Jeff Probst calls his favorite contestants by their last names, "superfan" John insisted he should receive the same honor. Jeff accepted the proposition and challenged him to live up to it. Despite knowing game theories, Cochran found himself unable to use them, and came across as socially awkward and physically unable. After Savaii lost the inaugural Immunity Challenge, Ozzy Lusth perceived him as the weakest member of the tribe, but was saved when tribemate Semhar Tadesse was voted out for her poor performance at the Immunity Challenge.\n\nCochran would continue to find himself on the outs of the tribe, but formed a close friendship with Savaii tribemate Dawn Meehan. Cochran also began becoming more of a provider for Savaii, despite Savaii's de facto leader Ozzy already doing most of the food collecting. At their next Tribal Council visit, Cochran was once again spared over the much weaker Mark Caruso, who was blamed for the loss despite Cochran being in charge of rope management during the Immunity Challenge. However, Cochran received a vote from Jim Rice, who was wary of the possibility of Mark really having a Hidden Immunity Idol. Cochran's odds in the tribe would soon increase after Jim recruited him to help blindside Elyse Umemoto, Ozzy's closest ally, after losing the Day 15 Immunity Challenge. The tribe lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 17, and the tribe as a whole told Cochran he was leaving, and that if he beat Christine Shields Markoski, he would come back into the game as a hero. However, Ozzy saw it as too risky after having a dream and introduced his new plan: "The Trojan Horse," where he asked to be voted out so that he could beat Christine, allowing the on the outs Cochran to make the merge. Ozzy gave Cochran his Hidden Immunity Idol for safekeeping just in case he lost, but would ask him to return the idol if he did return.\n\nSavaii wanted Cochran to become the double agent and gather intel from the Upolu tribe at the merge. Cochran, however, having notions of being "bullied" by his former Savaii tribemates, flipped over to the Upolu tribe during a talk with Coach Wade. At Tribal Council, it came down to a 6-6 tie between Upolu's Rick Nelson and Savaii's Keith Tollefson. However, when the tie votes came back, the Savaii tribe was stunned after realizing someone flipped, causing Keith to leave 6-4. Cochran admitted that he flipped to Ozzy and said that he would state his reasoning later. Jim called him a "coward," but Brandon Hantz came to his defense.\n\nCochran immediately became Savaii's number one enemy, with Whitney Duncan calling him "disgusting." Nevertheless, Cochran maintained his allegiance to the Upolu tribe, helping to take out Ozzy, Jim, Dawn, and Whitney at the following Tribal Councils, finding themselves competing each other at Redemption Island, with Ozzy successfully defeating them all. With no common enemy left, it had become clear that Cochran would be the first player out, since he was the last Savaii member remaining. Cochran didn't win individual immunity, but he pleaded his case to stay to the Upolu tribe members. However, it was not enough, as Cochran ended up leaving in a 5-2 vote (Edna Ma being the only player to vote with him).\n\nAt Redemption Island, Cochran was doubtful that he would stand a chance against Ozzy in the duel, but Ozzy falsely assured Cochran he had a chance (Ozzy believing he could blow out Cochran in the duel). Much to Ozzy's surprise, Cochran came close to winning in the duel after being far behind Ozzy. However, Ozzy managed to continue his Redemption Island winning streak, permanently eliminating Cochran from the game. Cochran left the game having enjoyed every moment he spent in it and glad that he put up a fight against Ozzy, despite his expected defeat.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, as a juror, he cast his jury vote for Coach, but Coach lost to Sophie in a 6-3-0 vote.	4	0	8	3	6	5.08	31	0.13

9	Dawn Meehan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Dawn_Meehan	2	Dawn was placed on the Savaii tribe where they gained returning player Ozzy. On Day 2, Dawn had a minor emotional breakdown which concerned Mark and Ozzy. Despite initially being an outsider to the Savaii Alliance along with Cochran (who she bonded with), Dawn remained loyal to him and joined the alliance in voting out other outsiders Semhar and Mark at their first two Tribal Councils for their dismal challenge performances. Following Mark's elimination, she and Cochran were recruited by one of the majority alliance members Jim to blindside one of the alliance's members Elyse due to her closeness with Ozzy. At Tribal Council, Keith and Whitney voted Dawn to avoid Ozzy's anger. But Jim's plan still came into fruition as Elyse was blindsided. After Savaii lost the Day 18 Immunity Challenge, the tribe initially wanted to vote out Cochran, but Ozzy thought it was too risky as he came up with a plan to be voted out on purpose and be sent to Redemption Island to defeat former Upolu Christine, who had dominated by winning the last five duels. At Tribal Council, Dawn joined the rest of the tribe in Ozzy's plan, purposefully sending him to Redemption Island where he ultimately defeated Christine in the last duel before the merge to immediately win his way back into the game.\n\nThe merge happened immediately after the duel, where Dawn and Cochran officially joined the Savaii Alliance. The former Savaii's wanted Cochran to be a "double agent" to get information from the Upolu's. But unknown to them, Cochran felt like he was being "bullied" and he flipped to Upolu after talking with Coach. Dawn won the first individual immunity for the women on Day 21. At Tribal Council, the vote resulted in a tie between Keith and original Upolu Rick. But in the revote, Cochran flipped on Savaii and voted Keith, sending him to Redemption Island. Now in the minority, Dawn and Whitney voted with The Family alliance at the next Tribal Council in sending Ozzy back to Redemption Island. She, Jim, and Whitney then competed in the next Immunity Challenge while the former Upolu tribe, and Cochran, opted out of the challenge in order to feast. But Dawn lost individual immunity to Whitney. At Tribal Council, the Upolu's voted out Jim over Dawn due to the former being a strategic threat. After the first post-merge Redemption Island duel, Cochran tried to regain Dawn and Whitney's trust to help them last further in the game. Dawn lost the next Immunity Challenge to Sophie, but had hope when Albert plotted with Sophie in blindsiding Edna. However, at Tribal Council, The Family alliance stayed intact, sending Dawn to Redemption Island for being too likable. Whitney soon followed behind her after a Double Elimination twist with an immediate Immunity Challenge occurred. Dawn and Whitney competed in the duel against Ozzy, but she and Whitney lost to Ozzy and became the third and fourth jury members.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, she voted for Sophie to be the Sole Survivor, helping her beat Coach and Albert to win the title in a 6-3-0 vote.	5	0	10	7	6	2.09	28	0.18
13	Brandon Hantz	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Brandon_Hantz	2	Brandon started as a member of the Upolu tribe, which would soon be joined by returning player Coach Wade. Within the first three days, Brandon became a member of a majority alliance in Upolu consisting of himself, Coach, Sophie Clarke, Albert Destrade, and Rick Nelson. Brandon hid the fact he was the nephew of former player Russell Hantz (going as far as to wearing his shirt covering the upper portion of his back where he had a Hantz tattoo while he was fishing), but ended up seeing it as too much of a burden to keep to himself, and told Coach on Day 4.\n\nBrandon also struggled with temptation and began to conspire against tribemate Mikayla Wingle. The Upolu five managed to control the merge and boot Christine Shields Markoski (who openly threatened returning players on the first day), Stacey Powell, and Mikayla at the three Tribal Councils Upolu attended. Although Brandon began to unravel and struggle more and more with his personal beliefs, he remained loyal to the Upolu five. When only the members of the original Upolu five remained, Brandon was the target for the Tribal Council, but surprised everyone when he won his first individual Immunity Challenge.\n\nLater on, Albert was called out on his deceit by Sophie, Brandon, and Rick. However, Brandon later made amends with Albert before Tribal Council, and gave up his immunity to Albert, feeling that he owed him. Brandon found himself betrayed by his allies in a 3-2 vote. At the final Redemption Island duel, despite putting up a good fight against Ozzy Lusth, he was beaten and became the seventh member of the jury. At the Final Tribal Council, Brandon was mainly bitter towards Albert, asking him if he knew if he was going home and only wanted a yes or no answer. When Albert said he didn't know, Brandon simply uttered "you lie" and sat back down. In the end, he cast his vote for Sophie to win Survivor: South Pacific. Sophie ended up winning in a 6-3-0 vote.	5	0	6	5	4	2.21	36	0.14

18	Sophie Clarke	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sophie_Clarke	2	Like most of her Upolu tribemates, Sophie was skeptical about the addition of Coach Wade to their tribe. This skepticism was furthered when Coach lost the first Reward Challenge over fellow returning player Ozzy Lusth. Upon reaching camp, Sophie introduced herself as a Russian and Economics major who "graduated four days ago." Knowing his "Dragon Slayer" baggage would be hard to release, Coach opened a conversation while stargazing at their first night, with the conversation concluding with the recruitment of Sophie to his five-person alliance, which also consisted of Albert Destrade, Brandon Hantz, and Rick Nelson. Coach fortified his alliance of five by adding a sixth member, Edna Ma. While Brandon kept his secret of being a relative of the infamous Russell Hantz from his tribemates, Sophie was observant enough to suspect he might be hiding something. Sophie was also seen as a strong competitor, being called "insane" by host Jeff Probst during the first Immunity Challenge, in which Upolu narrowly won.\n\nAfter the Immunity Challenge loss on Day 5, Sophie received a vote coming from Stacey Powell, but Sophie's majority alliance eliminated Coach's biggest threat, Christine Shields Markoski. Days later, alliance partner Albert found the hidden clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol, but could not find the Idol itself. With Sophie and Coach's help, the three found the Idol, which was secretly kept by Coach, even from Rick and Brandon. The Upolu majority alliance successfully eliminated Stacey and Mikayla Wingle at their next Tribal Councils, entering the merge with the entire alliance intact.\n\nWhen the tribes merged on Day 19 into the Te Tuna tribe, Sophie stuck with the Upolu alliance, and, along with Savaii member John Cochran, eliminated the five other Savaii members: Keith Tollefson, Ozzy, Jim Rice, Dawn Meehan, and Whitney Duncan. During the process of this "Pagonging," Sophie was able to win two consecutive Immunity Challenges, the second win which was especially key since she narrowly beat out Whitney.\n\nAfter the ex-Savaii members were voted out, the original Upolu alliance of five decided to stick together and eliminated Cochran and Edna. The next round of the game saw the alliance turn against each other. Sophie was able to make Coach and Rick turn against fellow alliance member Brandon because of his antics and his unpredictability. However, when Brandon won immunity, they had to switch their target to Albert. Their plans changed again at Tribal Council when Brandon gave the Immunity Necklace to Albert. In the end, Coach sided with Rick and Sophie voting out Brandon and she narrowly escaped being sent to Redemption Island in a 3-2 vote.\n\nAt the final Redemption Island duel on Day 36, Ozzy defeated Brandon and came back in the game with an apparent target on his back. At the following Immunity Challenge, which required balancing wooden blocks, Sophie made an unattractive gesture—outright asking Albert to help her get her blocks, which was intercepted by Jeff. Her move failed, however, when Ozzy won Immunity. With Ozzy immune and Coach having his Hidden Immunity Idol, Sophie was on the hot seat at Tribal Council, being told by Ozzy that she was a "pretentious, spoiled brat" after her gesture at the Immunity Challenge, reducing the medical student to tears and anxiety, stating that her bluntness was natural to her. Despite this, Sophie dodged elimination once again after Rick was voted out for his quieter gameplay in a 3-2 vote.\n\nAt the Final Immunity Challenge on Day 38, a closely-contested battle between Ozzy and Sophie commenced. But at the puzzle-building part, Ozzy struggled, giving leeway to Sophie, who eventually won the challenge. As the last remaining Savaii member, Ozzy was voted out, leaving Sophie (declaring herself "the new Dragon Slayer"), Albert, and Coach as the Final Three.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, while castigated by the jury for coming off as acerbic to others, Sophie used her frankness to her advantage by calling Coach "a little girl" and exposed all the lies he created. She also stated that she would change her perceived rudeness after Ozzy brought the topic up days ago. In the end, Sophie was rewarded the title of 23rd Sole Survivor and the million dollar prize, beating Coach and Albert in a 6-3-0 vote, receiving the votes of Brandon, Dawn, Jim, Keith, Ozzy, and Whitney.\n\nAt the Reunion Show, Sophie stated that it was hard for her to "act dumb", but she had to try in order to advance herself in the game.	7	0	1	7	8	1.79	39	0.18

6	Colton Cumbie	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Colton_Cumbie	2	When Colton and the other contestants arrived, Colton was hoping to be placed on a tribe with females. Instead, the teams were arranged according to gender, much to his dismay and dislike. He found consolation upon learning that his all-male Manono tribe will coexist with the all-female Salani tribe. Colton wasted no time mingling with the girls more than his own tribe, even as going far as not helping in the males' camp chores. He was well-liked by the women, on Day 3, Colton received a Hidden Immunity Idol from Salani member Sabrina Thompson, because it was exclusive for Manono's disposal. Thompson told him to use the idol to eliminate threats.\n\nBy Day 4, Colton's frequent visits to Salani started to grate the women, with the women telling him to get to know his own tribemates, something he did not do as much with Salani. Using the idol as leverage, he formed an unlikely Misfit Alliance with Troyzan Robertson, Leif Manson, Jonas Otsuji, and Tarzan Smith, to combat the "Muscle Alliance," consisted by Manono's strongest members.\n\nWhen Manono lost their first Immunity Challenge on Day 8, Colton began his strategy. His original target was Bill because of Bill's loss in the challenge and obnoxious behavior. However, the misfit alliance persuaded Colton to vote out Matt who was seen as a bigger threat. At Tribal Council, Colton revealed that he had an Immunity Idol to the rest of his team. Colton's alliance was successful on taking down one of the Muscles, Matt Quinlan.\n\nColton gained an enemy in Muscle Alliance member Bill Posley. Despite Bill having no problems at all with Colton, Colton viewed him as loud and obnoxious. On Day 11, a heated confrontation escalated between the two men when Colton became increasingly frustrated with Bill, refusing to talk to him, while Bill attempted to make amends with him. Colton then conversed with allies Troyzan and Jonas about giving up immunity to the women so that they could vote out Bill, however Tarzan and Troyzan felt that ally Leif should be the next to go, since he betrayed their trust by accidentally telling Bill that Colton wanted him out last round. Unanimously, Colton got his way and the men headed to Tribal Council. Another heated debate ensued between Bill and Colton when Colton revealed to Jeff that he did not like Bill because he was obnoxious, loud, and that he needed to "get a real job" instead of being a struggling stand-up comedian, which Bill did not accept lightly, saying it was his dream to be a comedian. Colton was then asked by Jeff if there are any black people in his personal life, and Colton responded that his house helper is black. In the end, Colton ultimately got his wish, and Bill was unanimously voted out.\n\nThe next day, a Tribe Switch occurred, and Colton remained at Manono, and in an unfortunate turn of events, the new Manono tribe, was almost entirely comprised of physically weaker competitors, save for Monica Culpepper. Colton likened their situation as "peasants" being pitted against "Greek Gods," referring to the much physically stronger new Salani tribe. Lucky for Colton, the majority of the Misfit alliance, Jonas, Tarzan and Leif, remained on his tribe as well. Colton approached their new members, Monica, Alicia Rosa, and Christina Cha, that he is still on board with the women, but in truth, he was making a play to blindside them. Colton conspired with Alicia, the only member of the Salani Alliance to be in the new Manono to eliminate the other two women, with Culpepper going first, as she is a physical threat. In a rather lopsided physical Immunity Challenge, Monica tried to solely carry the challenge for the tribe, but Manono's disadvantage sent them to Tribal Council. At Tribal Council, while Christina and Monica believed Colton (and Alicia) were on their side, Colton pulled a double-cross, blindsiding Monica in a 5-2 vote.\n\nReturning from Tribal Council, Colton and Alicia taunt Christina and tell her that she was going home next. Colton's dislike of Christina intensified at the next Reward Challenge, where Colton harped on Christina's poor performance. On Day 16, Colton began to complain about suffering a headache. Tarzan diagnosed it as dehydration and told Colton to drink more water. Colton stumbled into the forest where he collapsed on the ground and despite his mistreatment of her, Christina helped him walk back to camp. The medical team diagnosed Colton with acute appendicitis, and recommended him to be evacuated from the game. Before leaving, Jeff asked Colton on what to do with his Hidden Immunity Idol, and while Alicia assumed he will give it to her, Colton decided to keep the idol with him as a souvenir, after which he was carried away by a stretcher. Because of Colton's evacuation, there was no Challenge, and the tribes were convened at Tribal Council the next day, where they were informed about Colton's condition and removal from the game, and the announcement of the merge. At the Rites of Passage, the final four acknowledged Colton's impact during his short stay in the game.	4	1	13	6	7	4.83	16	0.25

18	Kim Spradlin	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kim_Spradlin	2	Kim caught the attention of Alicia Rosa during the trek to the girl's camp because she posed as a strong player, which forged her into Alicia's alliance, along with Chelsea Meissner, Kat Edorsson, and Sabrina Thompson. Kim's levelheadedness was proven when she shunned Manono member Colton Cumbie with poise and composure, despite Cumbie's constant visits to their side of camp as it started to annoy her tribe and viewed his affinity for them as a camouflaged act of sabotage. After the evacuation of tribemate Kourtney Moon, despite Chelsea and Kim discussing the possibility of booting Kat for her challenge ineptitude, the alliance stood strong and eliminated Salani's oldest member, Nina Acosta. Kim and the rest of the Salani tribe then prospered, winning three consecutive challenges, and received free immunity when the Manono tribe decided to go to Tribal Council after winning the Day 11 Immunity Challenge.\n\nKim remained a Salani member after the Day 12 tribe switch, where she formed a secondary alliance with newcomers Jay Byars, Michael Jefferson, and Troyzan Robertson, where she found herself in the leadership position. Kim increased her power by obtaining a Hidden Immunity Idol, which she disclosed to her closest ally, Chelsea. The forged alliance, however, did not need to take action, as the new Salani demolished the new Manono in subsequent challenges, merging with them with a 7-5 discrepancy, but the original members (men and women) remained 6-6.\n\nThe two revisions of the tribes found Kim working with two pacts, the all-girl original Salani alliance (Alicia's regrouped alliance with former outsider Christina Cha being adopted to the group) and the new Salani alliance. After Kim manipulated Jay and Troyzan to oust Jonas Otsuji and cannibalize new Salani alliance member Michael, she eventually revealed her master plan—blindside Jay and Troyzan to pave the way for an all-girl endgame. The plan worked, and the men took the fall in subsequent Tribal Councils, though one of her longtime allies, Kat, was disposed of by Kim after the latter's controversial choice of who to bring with her after winning a Reward Challenge and Kat giving Kim a bad attitude after Kim won Immunity.\n\nThroughout the merge, Kim collectively won four of the last five Immunity Challenges, and, with a Hidden Immunity Idol in her possession, Kim was essentially invincible. After Kat's elimination, Kim convinced Alicia that Tarzan was the mastermind of the tribe, pledging her loyalty to her and driving the vote against Tarzan Smith. Following her victory at the final two Immunity Challenges, and the eliminations of Alicia and Christina, Kim found herself in the final three with her closest friends, Chelsea and Sabrina. Kim's quiet yet destructive strategy, and avoiding the target despite how strong she appeared in the merge, earned the respect and votes of seven of nine jury members, crowning her as the 24th Sole Survivor.\n\nAt the live Reunion Show, Kim received an additional $100,000 for winning the Fan Favorite Award.	12	1	1	9	10	3.79	39	0.31

5	Monica Culpepper	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Culpepper	2	Monica was originally placed at the all-women Salani tribe and found herself immediately on the outs. Alicia Rosa created a five-person alliance with Sabrina Thompson, Kim Spradlin, Chelsea Meissner, and Kat Edorsson. Despite not being in the majority alliance, she was not targeted for elimination due to her strength needed for challenges, even with Salani's three-challenge losing streak. Monica remained safe for the next two cycles when Salani won their first Immunity Challenge, and after a controversial move by the enemy Manono tribe of going to Tribal Council after winning an Immunity Challenge.\n\nMonica's fate took a turn for the worst after a Day 12 tribe switch, where she, along with Alicia and Christina Cha, were transferred to the new Manono tribe, who fared dismally in challenges against an athletic, new Salani tribe. Losing the next Immunity Challenge, Monica lobbied to vote out the oldest male on the tribe, Tarzan Smith, by commissioning Colton Cumbie, who bonded with the original Salani, to help her in her effort. Unknown to Monica, Colton and Alicia were plotting against her, and with the help of Colton's "misfit alliance", Monica and Christina were both shocked when Monica was blindsided in a 5-2 vote in an effort to rid the game of a potential threat as opposed to a weak link.	3	0	14	6	4	1.2	14	0.21

11	Troyzan Robertson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Troyzan_Robertson	2	Troyzan started the game on the all-male Manono tribe. He joined Colton Cumbie's Misfit Alliance along with tribemates Jonas Otsuji, Leif Manson, and Tarzan Smith. As Manono won the first two Immunity Challenges, he was never in danger of being voted out until Day 8 where his alliance voted out Matt Quinlan. On Day 11, Troyzan agreed to give up immunity to go to Tribal Council where his alliance eliminated Bill Posley.\n\nAt the tribe switch, Troyzan was switched to the Salani tribe along with tribemates Jay Byars and Michael Jefferson. While on Salani, Troyzan made an alliance with Jay, Chelsea Meissner, and Kim Spradlin. However, the alliance did not need to vote anybody out as Salani won the next Immunity Challenge and Colton was medically evacuated in the following days. After Colton's evacuation, the tribes were merged into the Tikiano tribe during the Joint Tribal Council on Night 17.\n\nTroyzan won the first post-merge Immunity Challenge and despite thinking that Jonas deserved to stay, he ended up voted with his post-swap alliance in ousting Jonas. Knowing the women had the numbers advantage, the men were thinking of voting out Christina Cha next. However, Kim lied to Troyzan about Michael wanting him gone. Motivated by his reignited anger towards Michael, he voted with the women, eliminating Michael. However, Troyzan was shocked at the next Tribal Council when the women in his alliance betrayed the alliance and blindsided Jay.\n\nThe women continued voting out the men, with Troyzan being safe by winning individual immunity on Day 27 with Leif being voted out at that night's Tribal Council. On Day 30, after Troyzan failed to win immunity, he took the loss hard and turned his back for the duration of the Immunity Challenge. That night at Tribal Council, despite an effort to mess with the majority Salani Alliance's split vote plan and get Christina out, he was eliminated for being the strongest male contestant left, as well as his clashes with the women.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Troyzan cast his jury vote for Sabrina Thompson out of spite against Kim; still, this was not enough to prevent Kim from winning the title of Sole Survivor.	11	1	8	4	6	4.45	30	0.37
12	Kat Edorsson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kat_Edorsson	2	Kat began the game on the all-female Salani tribe, where she was quickly recruited into an alliance with Alicia Rosa, Kim Spradlin, Chelsea Meissner, and Sabrina Thompson. Despite being in the majority, Kat faced the threat of being eliminated after she failed to follow directions during the second Immunity Challenge on Day 5, jumping into the water several times when she wasn't supposed to. However, Kat's alliance remained loyal to her and voted out Nina Acosta. At the Day 12 Tribe Switch, Kat remained on Salani and later became a member of the merged Tikiano tribe.\n\nAt the merge, Kat continued to aid her alliance in eliminating the men from the game. Prior to the Day 28 Reward Challenge, Kat made a deal with Kim that if one of them won reward, they would pick the other, in order to keep Troyzan Robertson from plotting. However, Kat was angered when Kim went back on their deal by choosing Chelsea and Alicia over her. Troyzan made use of this by telling Kat that she was at the bottom of her alliance, further upsetting her. Ultimately, Troyzan's manipulation managed to get to Kat, who didn't want to be seen as a weak player and a follower. Despite considering flipping on her alliance, Kat stuck by the women to vote out Troyzan, who patted her on the back and whispered to her "do it" before departing.\n\nOn Day 31, Kat and her cousin Robby managed to win the Loved Ones Reward Challenge, and Kat chose to take Alicia and Kim (along with their loved ones) with her. This move angered Sabrina, who believed Tarzan Smith and Christina Cha deserved to go on the reward more. With this, a sub-alliance started against Kat. Kat fought hard during the next Immunity Challenge, and begged Kim to let her win, but Kim didn't give up and won.\n\nAfter the challenge, Alicia pitched the idea of voting out Kat, but Kim was initially against it, believing Sabrina to be a bigger threat, but eventually relented. At Tribal Council, Kat's naivete and selfishness were hot topics, much to her chagrin. Chelsea even pointed out that Kat constantly used her age as an excuse for her actions. Before the vote, Kat commented about how she thought blindsides were "fun". That night, Kat was blindsided in a 6-1 vote, and sobbed as she walked away from Tribal Council.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, she expressed she was hurt by Kim for voting her out. But instead of fully berating her, Kat told everyone that she would be having open heart surgery when she turned 24, and she didn't tell anyone this to avoid them giving her sympathy jury votes. By saying so, she told the jurors to not focus on their anger and to forgive instead. Ultimately, Kat was one of seven jurors who awarded Kim their votes, giving her the title of Sole Survivor for her masterful strategy. 	8	0	7	7	4	1.25	33	0.24

18	Denise Stapley	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Denise_Stapley	2	Denise started on the Matsing tribe. She started out in a good position as her occupation as a sex therapist helped her social game, as she connected with Zane Knight and Malcolm Freberg, her and the latter of which formed the Matsing Alliance. When Matsing lost the first Immunity Challenge on Day 3, the tribe initially wanted to vote out Russell Swan for poorly choosing the roles for everyone in the challenge and also barking out orders. However, Zane asked the tribe to vote him out for costing the challenge, but it was actually a ruse to gain sympathy on those who liked him and wanted him around. At Tribal Council, Denise joined the rest of the tribe in blindsiding Zane unanimously as his plan backfired. Early the next morning, Roxy Morris approached Denise about Angie Layton and Malcolm cuddling overnight, believing them to be a power couple and wanting to vote Angie out to break up the pair. But unbeknownst to her, Malcolm was Denise's ally. Denise later became annoyed by Roxy for her laziness around camp and religious beliefs minutes before going into the Day 6 Immunity Challenge. Matsing lost immunity again by a small margin. Roxy and Russell attempted to swing Denise to split up Angie and Malcolm while still unaware that Denise was Malcolm's ally. At Tribal Council, Denise joined the rest of the tribe in voting out Roxy unanimously. When Matsing lost their third challenge in a row on Day 8, Denise and Malcolm were split between voting Angie or Russell due to their weak performances in the challenge. At Tribal Council, they decided to send Angie home for being a liability in challenges. Denise and Malcolm became suspicious that Russell already had the Hidden Immunity Idol and considered blindsiding him at the next Tribal Council. When Matsing lost their final challenge on Day 10, Denise and Malcolm agreed to vote for Russell as they tried to make him feel comfortable heading into Tribal Council just in case he had the idol. At Tribal Council, everyone was concerned that they were going home, but in the end, Russell was sent home.\n\nBefore the Reward Challenge, Denise and Malcolm thought there was a chance of a tribe absorption, so they looked for the idol, which Malcolm found first. Even though they were in an alliance, the idol was in Malcolm's possession. At the Reward Challenge, Denise was separated from Malcolm and she was absorbed into the Kalabaw tribe. Kalabaw lost the Reward Challenge, but faced another setback when they lost Dana Lambert after she was too sick to continue. When Kalabaw lost the next Immunity Challenge on Day 13, Denise joined the men's Kalabaw Alliance and discussed voting out Katie Hanson or Sarah Dawson for their weak challenge performances. At Tribal Council, Denise joined the Kalabaw Alliance and Katie in voting out Dawson. Kalabaw won the next Reward Challenge after Jonathan Penner made a deal with the rival Tandang tribe that Kalabaw would give up their remaining rice supply in exchange for the reward. When Kalabaw lost the last Immunity Challenge before the merge, Denise joined the rest of the tribe in voting out Katie unanimously for her weak challenge performances and being the only outsider left. Returning from Tribal Council, Denise was in distress as she has been to every Tribal Council, believing that she was cursed.\n\nDenise made the merge on Day 17, as a member of the Dangrayne tribe where she and Carter Williams won the first individual Immunity Challenge on Day 19. Denise then joined the split vote plan between Jonathan and RC Saint-Amour to flush out Jonathan's idol. At Tribal Council, the split vote plan came into fruition when Jonathan played his idol, making RC the first member of the jury. But she, Malcolm, and the Kalabaw Alliance were then left in the dark when Jeff Kent was blindsided by the Tandang Alliance at the next Tribal Council.\n\nWhen the foursome of Denise, Malcolm, Jonathan, and Carter won the next Reward Challenge, they agreed to break up the Tandang Alliance by getting Michael Skupin and Lisa Whelchel to flip since they were on the bottom of the alliance. After Skupin won immunity on Day 25, Denise suggested to her alliance that they vote for Artis Silvester as a safe vote against Abi-Maria Gomes playing her idol that she revealed along with Malcolm's on Day 22, as she believed Abi-Maria would be too selfish to play her idol for Artis. At Tribal Council, although Lisa stayed loyal to Tandang, Skupin flipped and blindsided Artis. Skupin and Lisa then joined the Kalabaw Alliance. However, their flipping started a rivalry between Abi-Maria and Denise. Denise, Malcolm, Skupin, and Lisa then made a final four alliance. The Kalabaw Alliance then decided to split the vote between Abi-Maria and her ally Pete Yurkowski in case Abi-Maria played her idol, but Skupin considered flipping on the plan and blindsiding Malcolm when Abi-Maria and Pete tried to sway him, Lisa, and the former Kalabaw's. At Tribal Council, Skupin stuck to the plan as Abi-Maria played her idol and Pete became the fourth juror. When Abi-Maria surprised everyone by winning immunity on Day 30 after she bought an advantage at the Survivor Auction, the final four alliance decided to target Jonathan, but he was trying to sway votes against Denise in case Malcolm played his idol by getting Skupin to flip. At Tribal Council, Skupin once again stayed loyal as Jonathan was sent to the jury. Denise then joined the rest of the tribe in voting out the last original Kalabaw member Carter. She was then spared when Abi-Maria was voted out as Skupin and Lisa wanted to keep Denise around to have a chance at beating Malcolm in the Final Immunity Challenge.\n\nAt the final four, Malcolm won an advantage for the Final Immunity Challenge that included a sealed note he must open at the Immunity Challenge. After the Reward Challenge, knowing that Skupin and Lisa weren't going to vote against each other, Denise asked Malcolm if he was willing to commit with her to forcing a tie vote between herself and Lisa at the next Tribal Council, but he hesitated to committing to the deal due to how dangerous Denise's social game was going into the Final Tribal Council. This made Denise suspicious of Malcolm's loyalty and forced her to strike a Final Three deal with Skupin and Lisa to vote out Malcolm if he were to lose the Final Immunity Challenge, but Denise was concerned about Skupin due to him flip-flopping on his decisions and was also unknown to the fact that Skupin and Lisa made the same deal with Malcolm during their previous reward. Malcolm wasted away his advantage as he did indeed lose the Final Immunity Challenge, putting Denise's plan into action. Back at camp, Denise and Malcolm made their pitch to Skupin and Lisa to keep them in the game. At Tribal Council, Skupin and Lisa chose to keep Denise and voted Malcolm out as the eighth and final jury member, with Malcolm bitterly congratulating Denise on the way out.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Denise made her opening statement saying that she used her social game to adapt in three different tribes and also create sub alliances, but had to turn on them to further herself in the game. She also stated that she has survived every Tribal Council of the season because of her social game, as she had outwitted, outplayed, and outlasted everyone by doing so. While she came under fire for being an appeasing sex therapist by Malcolm and betraying alliances, Skupin's lack of social awareness and Lisa's inconsistent loyalties along with Denise's social game earned her the title of Sole Survivor in a 6-1-1 vote, only losing RC and Carter's votes as they voted Lisa and Skupin respectively.	4	0	1	9	8	2.64	39	0.10
12	Jonathan Penner	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Penner	3	Jonathan returned with fellow former evacuated contestants Michael Skupin and Russell Swan and was placed on the Kalabaw tribe. Jonathan was immediately targeted by the other castaways on his tribe, as they, mainly Jeff Kent, did not want a returning player to win the game. On Day 4, Jonathan managed to find Kalabaw's Hidden Immunity Idol from the top of the rice box. Things began to look up for Jonathan, as he formed a three-person alliance with Jeff and Carter Williams, creating a men versus women scenario within the tribe. However, votes never had to happen as Kalabaw continued their winning streak.\n\nOn Day 11, the Matsing tribe was dissolved and Kalabaw gained Denise Stapley. However, the following day, Kalabaw lost their first original member after Dana Lambert became ill and decided to quit the game. Kalabaw lost the next two Immunity Challenges, and Denise joined the men's alliance, helping to vote out Sarah Dawson and Katie Hanson respectively.\n\nWhen Kalabaw merged with Tandang into the Dangrayne tribe on Day 17, Carter and Jeff plotted with the Tandang Alliance to target Jonathan. Jonathan attempted to talk Tandang outsiders Michael and RC Saint-Amour into flipping, however, Michael decided to vote against Jonathan when Jeff approached him. At Tribal Council, Jonathan played his Hidden Immunity Idol out of nervousness that his allies had turned on him. RC received the next highest number of votes due to a split vote plan organized by Malcolm Freberg and became the first member of the jury. After Tribal Council, Jonathan was furious that his allies had betrayed him and considered himself alone on the island. Jonathan then managed to pull out a come-from-behind victory at the next Immunity Challenge, throwing plans to vote him out into a tailspin. At a chaotic Tribal Council, the votes were split between Jeff and Pete Yurkowski, with Jeff leaving 5-4-1. Jonathan threw a vote to Abi-Maria Gomes in an effort to spook her as he admitted to not knowing what was going on; had Jonathan voted with Carter, Denise, Jeff, and Malcolm, the vote would have been tied.\n\nBack at camp, the remnants of the original Kalabaw and Matsing tribes realized that they needed to get rid of the Tandang Alliance of Abi-Maria, Pete, and Artis Silvester. Although the Tandang Alliance again targeted Jonathan at the next Tribal Council, the Kalabaw-Matsing coalition managed to get Michael to flip over and boot Artis in a 5-4 vote. The next day, Jonathan tried to get Lisa Whelchel to join their coalition, appealing to her past as a teen star and how she would appear to the television audience. At the next vote, Lisa and Michael joined the Kalabaw-Matsing coalition, helping split votes between Abi-Maria and Pete. Abi-Maria then played her Hidden Immunity Idol, sending Pete home in a 3-2-0 vote.\n\nLisa and Michael then approached Jonathan with a final four deal with him and Carter, feeling skeptical about working with Denise and Malcolm. However, Jonathan turned down their offer as he thought that it was too early to make sub-alliances. At the next Immunity Challenge, Abi-Maria shocked everyone when she won after receiving a Challenge Advantage at the Survivor Auction. At Tribal Council, Jonathan campaigned for Denise and Malcolm to leave, saying that if either of them got to the end, they would win. However, Jonathan faced the consequences of rejecting the final four deal as Lisa and Michael joined Denise and Malcolm in voting out Jonathan in a 4-3 vote. Before leaving Tribal Council, Jonathan hugged Carter and when Abi-Maria asked for a hug, Jonathan coldly told her that he was not hugging anyone else. Jonathan departed from Tribal Council whistling, and he took a bow before finally disappearing into the trees, eliciting a bemused shrug from host Jeff Probst.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Jonathan addressed Denise, Lisa, and Michael, berating them all and even exposing Lisa's past as a teen star to the jury and other finalists, although he kept her secret while playing. In the end, Jonathan voted for Denise to win, helping give her the victory in a 6-1-1 vote.	8	1	7	7	8	4.45	30	0.27

17	Michael Skupin	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Skupin	2	Returning to play after his premature elimination a decade prior, Michael started his second chance on the Tandang tribe. Right off the bat, he recognized fellow tribemate Lisa Whelchel as a former TV star, but he kept the information to himself. He had the best start out of the three returning player, finding himself in an alliance before either Jonathan Penner or Russell Swan. At the beach, he was approached by RC Saint-Amour to join her alliance with Abi-Maria Gomes and Pete Yurkowski. They targeted Lisa for being considered untrustworthy, despite Michael personally liking her. He later informed her that he knew who she was, and they started to develop a friendship despite being on opposite alliances.\n\nWhen Abi-Maria and Pete turned against their alliance and recruited Lisa and Artis Silvester into a new majority voting bloc, Michael and RC were put in the minority, putting them in danger, although most of the pressure was on RC due to her conflict with Abi-Maria. However, Tandang continuously winning Immunity Challenges kept them safe from Tribal Council.\n\nWhen the Matsing tribe was down to 2 people, Malcolm Freberg was absorbed by Tandang and was promptly accepted by the majority alliance. Malcolm's challenge prowess made Tandang even stronger, and Michael was able to reach the merge without attending a single Tribal Council.\n\nThe tribe soon merged with Kalabaw into the Dangrayne tribe where Pete, Abi-Maria, Artis, Malcolm, and Lisa sided with Kalabaw members Jeff Kent, Carter Williams, and Denise Stapley (also a former Matsing tribe member and an ally of Malcolm) in order to split their votes between Jonathan, since Jeff, although aligned with Jonathan in the Kalabaw Alliance, did not want a returning player to win, and RC, since Pete distrusted her from Day 1. Meanwhile, Jonathan and RC, who knew that they were at the bottom of the Tandang Alliance, attempted to appeal to the Kalabaw Alliance in order to vote out the other Tandang members, targeting Pete, but Michael eventually shifted his vote to Jonathan who played a Hidden Immunity Idol, negating Michael's and the 4 other votes, eliminating Michael's ally, RC, who received 4 votes after the majority split their votes.\n\nWithout RC, Michael became a target next to Jonathan. After the next Reward Challenge, he, along with Jonathan, Malcolm, Denise, and Lisa, considered themselves the heroes of the game, while Artis, Abi-Maria, and Pete were portrayed as the bullies of the tribe, which would have meant that they would all stick together and blindside the three. However, Lisa realized that she could have a better chance of winning if she stuck with Tandang, deciding to still eliminate Jonathan. Their plan was foiled when Jonathan won the Immunity Challenge, which changed the plans of the Tandang Alliance. With Michael possibly being in danger for being the only returning player not having immunity and Lisa wanting to keep Tandang intact, Lisa planned to blindside Malcolm, knowing that Malcolm had Matsing's Hidden Immunity Idol, which Malcolm denied having to the Tandang Alliance. During the next very intense Tribal Council where Abi-Maria and Malcolm revealed their Hidden Immunity Idols, Michael was put in the middle with Jonathan arguing to vote against Pete, while Lisa arguing to go with Pete's "Plan B", Jeff. Michael eventually sided with Tandang, voting out Jeff after a 5-4-1 split with Kalabaw and Matsing, except Jonathan, voting against Pete, Tandang against Jeff, and Jonathan against Abi-Maria.\n\nWith the returning players' threat eliminated, Michael and Lisa were wooed by the newly solidified Kalabaw-Matsing Alliance to join them due to Tandang's treatment of the two. Lisa still voted with Tandang in the next Tribal Council, however, Michael eventually flipped on Tandang by blindsiding Artis (a plan of Denise due to Artis being the least likely receiver of Tandang's idol), \n\nThe next day, Lisa joined the new majority alliance with Michael, deciding to split their votes between Abi-Maria and Pete since they knew that Abi-Maria had Tandang's idol. With neither Pete or Abi-Maria winning immunity, they tried to sway Michael back to their side by blindsiding Malcolm (possibly using Tandang's idol on Pete as Michael would then vote against Malcolm). However, Michael stayed loyal to the majority alliance, with Pete being voted out. \n\nDuring those times, Malcolm and Michael talked about being in the final four. Michael was then offered by Malcolm a final four alliance with their alliance mates Lisa and Denise, where Michael first asked Lisa about it. Lisa hesitantly thought about the plan and approached Jonathan first to make a final four deal along with Carter, but Jonathan refused (saying that it would be early to make such a move) prompting Michael and Lisa to lock in the final four alliance with Matsing. With Abi-Maria winning the next Immunity Challenge with the help of the advantage she bought during the Survivor Auction, the six-person alliance turned on each other. Michael ended up being the swing vote between Denise and Jonathan after Lisa said to Jonathan that she would stick with her new alliance, and even after Jonathan's rallying to vote with him, Michael stuck with the final four alliance voting out Jonathan.\n\nBefore the next Immunity Challenge, Michael and Lisa, with the help of a self-esteem boost from Lisa's brother, Justice (who visited the island for a Loved Ones Challenge), planned to blindside Malcolm with the help of Carter. This plan failed, however, as Malcolm won immunity, with the alliance voting out Carter over Abi-Maria for being a physical threat. Michael won the next Reward Challenge, where he was allowed to select two people to join him, choosing his closest ally Lisa, with Malcolm as well. During the reward, Malcolm made a Final Three deal with Michael and Lisa and plotted to blindside Denise. After the next Immunity Challenge where Malcolm won immunity, Michael and Lisa debated to either keep Abi-Maria for being the least likely to get jury votes or Denise in order to have more competition against Malcolm to prevent him from getting immunity. During Tribal Council, Michael was called a "moron" by Abi-Maria for not wanting to take her to the end. Even after Abi-Maria tried to get Michael and Lisa to her side saying that Denise or Malcolm would win over them, Michael voted with the others against Abi-Maria, voting her out.\n\nDown to the final four, Michael thought of either voting out Malcolm or Denise, saying that defeating Malcolm would be honorable. Malcolm won the next Reward Challenge which would give him a huge advantage at the Final Immunity Challenge. Despite Malcolm's advantage, he ended up being the first one out, while Michael ended up winning the challenge. Even though Lisa and Denise decided to vote out Malcolm, Michael was still undecided on who to vote out. At the next Tribal Council, Michael eventually decided to go with the women, voting out Malcolm.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Michael expressed to the jury being a returning player and surviving each time, saying that there was always a threat of him being voted out and that he exemplified the slogan of Survivor ("Outwit, Outplay, Outlast"). The jury, however, castigated him for not really being in danger seeing that he had no votes ever cast against him. Michael eventually lost against Denise, tying for first runner-up with Lisa, earning his only jury vote from Carter.	10	0	2	9	8	4.14	39	0.26

15	Malcolm Freberg	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Malcolm_Freberg	3	Malcolm started the game on the Matsing tribe. Due to his physical ability and his personality, he started out in a good position and made friends quickly, most notably with Angie Layton, Denise Stapley, and Zane Knight. After observing Russell Swan's actions around camp, Malcolm was the first to bring up potentially voting him off, but added that it had to be at the right time, since on paper Russell did bring some useful qualities to the tribe. Matsing lost the first Immunity Challenge and Malcolm was tempted to vote Russell off but Zane told the tribe that he felt he was at fault in the challenge and Russell had to drag Zane through most of it, so Zane deserved to go. However Zane didn't really want to go, which made the decision a bit more difficult. Malcolm along with the rest of the tribe voted Zane off. Malcolm and Angie began cuddling more and more and Roxy Morris noticed this and targeted Angie. Malcolm was hoping Denise would realize there is no more between him and Angie than there is between him and Denise, and Denise did realize this and helped him in sending Roxy out of the game on Day 6. The tribe morale was pretty low in "This Isn't a 'We' Game" since they were already down to four members as opposed to the six on Tandang and six on Kalabaw. The alliance of Malcolm, Angie, and Denise seemed confident Russell would go next if they lost again, but after losing their third Immunity Challenge and seeing both Angie and Russell struggle, it was a tough decision and Malcolm decided to vote against Angie, sending her home. In "Create a Little Chaos", Russell spent a lot of time looking for the idol which concerned Malcolm. Matsing lost their fourth and what turned out to be last challenge on Day 10, Malcolm and Denise stuck together and voted Russell off after he failed to find the idol. This left Malcolm and Denise with little hope and a big mountain to climb.\n\nBefore the Reward Challenge, Malcolm and Denise thought there was a chance of a tribe absorption, so they looked for the idol and Malcolm found it first so even though they were in an alliance, it became Malcolm's idol. At the Reward Challenge, Malcolm was separated from Denise and he was absorbed into the Tandang tribe. Malcolm contributed to the Reward Challenge win and received a warm reception from his new tribe. For the next few days, Malcolm enjoyed being on a strong tribe where he made zero enemies and he helped them dominate in challenges, seeing Kalabaw's numbers shrink from seven to four, with Matsing ally Denise managing to stay strong.\n\nMalcolm made the merged tribe Dangrayne and the then-dominant Tandang alliance led by Pete Yurkowski and Abi-Maria Gomes decided to target the returning players Michael Skupin and Jonathan Penner, as well as RC Saint-Amour, who appeared to be Michael's biggest ally. Malcolm didn't appear to be in any immediate danger despite being a physical threat except for when Lisa Whelchel accidentally discovered Malcolm's Hidden Immunity Idol when she was doing laundry, forcing them to align with each other. Malcolm voted for Jonathan, although Penner cancelled his votes with his Hidden Immunity Idol, which eliminated RC instead. Due to the antagonistic natures of Abi, Pete, and Artis Silvester, as well as the amount of control they had, Malcolm became part of a new alliance with Jeff Kent, Carter Williams, Penner, and Denise. They needed either Lisa or Michael to flip but Tandang remained strong and voted Jeff out in a close vote on Day 22. That same Tribal Council, Malcolm revealed his Hidden Immunity Idol to his whole tribe, putting a real target on his back for the first time but also gaining the trust of his allies. In "Little Miss Perfect", Malcolm's alliance targeted Artis for being the least likely recipient of Abi's Hidden Immunity Idol (revealed on Day 22 along with Malcolm's) and they fortunately convinced Michael to flip to their side and Artis was blindsided.\n\nIn "Whiners Are Wieners", Lisa decided to abandon the doomed Tandang alliance giving Malcolm's alliance enough numbers to split the votes between Abi and Pete as they flushed Abi's idol and eliminated Pete. In the final 7, Lisa and Michael approached Denise and Malcolm (after being denied by Penner) to make a final four deal, in which they accepted. This new core alliance was put to the test when the intended target, Abi, won immunity. The four stuck together and got rid of the perceived biggest threat Penner. Abi was spared once again after Carter was voted off since he was a physical threat, and then Abi was finally voted off after pretending to have an Immunity Idol.\n\nAt the Tribal Council where Abi's elimination took place, Malcolm and Denise were called out as threats to win, which concerned Malcolm. Both Malcolm and Denise felt that going to the end with each other was risky and they would have a better chance of winning if they went with Lisa and Michael, who each backstabbed a lot of people to get to the final four. Malcolm won the reward on Day 37 which was an advantage at the Final Immunity Challenge. Even with his advantage though, Malcolm was the first person eliminated from the challenge. Since Michael won immunity, Malcolm still had a chance if he could convince Lisa and Michael to take him to the end over Denise. Ultimately, Malcolm was seen as the bigger threat and was voted off 3-1. While leaving Tribal Council, he bitterly said "Congratulations Denise".\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Malcolm asked Denise why she played a better game than the other two finalists. Despite berating her for being an appeasing therapist, Malcolm ultimately contributed towards his ally's victory by voting for Denise to win, and she became Sole Survivor by a 6-1-1 vote.	10	1	4	8	9	4.71	38	0.26
14	Abi-Maria Gomes	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Abi-Maria_Gomes	2	Abi-Maria was part of the yellow Tandang tribe. Early on, she formed an alliance with RC Saint-Amour and soon used her flirtatious and charming attitude to recruit Pete Yurkowski while RC recruited their returning player Michael Skupin and formed a majority alliance. Abi-Maria, along with the rest of the tribe, viewed their oldest female member, Lisa Whelchel, as an outsider, agreeing she would be the first to go. However, at the first Immunity Challenge, Abi-Maria and Lisa won their tribe a second-place finish, keeping the tribe intact.\n\nAs days went on, Abi-Maria was so trusted by RC, the latter shared her clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol with her. However, Abi-Maria started to distrust her after noticing RC talking to Michael more than her and mistakenly thought the two were conniving behind her back. This prompted the business student to threaten RC. Abi-Maria's trust in RC completely dissolved on Day 7 when Abi-Maria found the idol clue inside RC's bag. Convinced that RC was trying to find the idol for herself, Abi-Maria brought in Pete, Lisa, and Artis Silvester in a new alliance to vote out RC and Michael. Unbeknownst to Abi-Maria, the clue in RC's bag was a ploy by Pete to cause chaos within the tribe. With Pete's help, Abi-Maria realized that the idol was actually the handle of their rice bin. Despite the dysfunction of the tribe Tandang established themselves as the most dominant of the three tribes, winning the next three Immunity Challenges.\n\nOn Day 12, the winless and decimated Matsing tribe was dissolved, one of its two remaining members, Malcolm Freberg was randomly assigned to Tandang. This shift, along with Malcolm's general likability and strength made it easier for Abi-Maria and Pete to sway the newcomer to their side. Tandang would remain undefeated by winning the next Immunity Challenge.\n\nIn a rather physical Reward Challenge on Day 14, the tribes struck a deal after finding themselves in a stalemate, with Michael brokering a deal with Kalabaw's returning player, Jonathan Penner, that, if Tandang forfeited the challenge, Kalabaw would give them their remaining rice supply. Abi-Maria and several members of Tandang were irate at Michael for making deals in their tribe's name as it turned out that Kalabaw's rice supply was not as plentiful they had hoped. The incident however, was inconsequential, as Tandang still won the next Immunity Challenge. Abi-Maria's tribe found themselves entering the merge with all of her Tandang tribemates intact. On Day 17, the tribe moved to the abandoned Matsing camp for the merge, and the Dangrayne tribe was born.\n\nHaving successfully colluded with the other alliances to split the vote between Jonathan and RC at the merge, resulting in RC's elimination, Abi-Maria was soon classified as one of the three "bullies" of the tribe along with fellow Tandang tribe mates Artis and Pete. But despite this negative connotation, they still managed to vote out Jeff Kent when Lisa and Michael decided to stay true to Tandang and Jonathan voted for Abi-Maria instead of Pete with the rest of his alliance. Jeff became the second member of the jury. It was at this Tribal Council where Abi-Maria revealed that she had a Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nDue to Abi-Maria's negativity towards Lisa, the latter joined forces with Michael and decided to jump ship and blindside Artis in order to dwindle Pete and Abi-Maria's power. Pete and Abi-Maria soon became the odd men out, which made it top priority for Pete to win immunity since Abi-Maria had the idol, although Pete failed to win. After a failed persuasion of Michael, Pete soon became the next member of the jury after Abi-Maria was forced to play her Hidden Immunity Idol to stay safe.\n\nDuring the Survivor Auction, originally not going to spend anything since she knew she was the next target, Abi-Maria imminently changed her mind upon seeing that an advantage in the game was available and she spent all her cash on it. It was revealed that this advantage would allow her to skip the first two parts of the next Immunity Challenge and have a 1 in 3 chance at winning immunity. She then devised a plan to make a fake Hidden Immunity Idol and pretend that the "advantage" she bought had 2 parts, one was for the Immunity Challenge and the other being the clue to the fake Hidden Immunity Idol. Everyone was in shock when Abi-Maria won her first and only Immunity Challenge, making her safe for Tribal Council and sending Jonathan home. After Jonathan hugged Carter Williams goodbye, Abi-Maria also asked for a hug, but Jonathan coldly rejected saying he was not hugging anyone else.\n\nWith the fake idol still in her pocket, Abi-Maria felt that she was safe, thinking that she fooled the whole tribe into thinking that she really had an idol. The rest of the tribe had doubts in Abi-Maria's idol but at Tribal Council the tribe voted out Carter since he was a threat in challenges and was more likely to win the game, reasoning that this move would also force the "idol" out of Abi-Maria.\n\nWith only five people left, Abi-Maria tried to convince Lisa that Malcolm, Michael, and Denise Stapley were definitely going to take each other to the final 3 and that they needed to vote Malcolm or Denise out in order to have a chance at winning since they would be the most likely win. She tried to position herself as the swing vote by appealing to Michael and Lisa and told them that they would not stand a chance against Malcolm and Denise in the final 3, even going to the extent of calling Michael an idiot once and a moron twice. But Lisa and Michael decided before Tribal Council that Malcolm was the real threat and that they needed Denise in the final 4 in order to ensure that Malcolm did not win immunity, so they rejected Abi-Maria's offer to vote out Denise and instead voted for Abi-Maria via unanimous decision.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Denise apologized to Abi-Maria for her less than congenial approach to their relationship. Putting her respect for the game ahead of their tumultuous relationship, Abi-Maria cast her jury vote for Denise, helping her rival win in a 6-1-1 vote.	9	1	5	4	6	2.31	36	0.25
4	Russell Swan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Russell_Swan	2	Russell returned to the game for a second time, becoming a member of the Matsing tribe. Russell vocally announced that he did not want to be Matsing's leader, wanting to avoid what happened to him the first time around. However, Russell still gave out orders, causing fellow tribe members Angie Layton and Malcolm Freberg to consider voting him out at the earliest opportunity. Matsing managed to lose the first Immunity Challenge on Day 3, but Russell was spared when Zane Knight's strategy of asking to be voted out (to feel out who wanted him around) backfired, and he was unanimously voted out 5-1.\n\nRussell would soon gain an ally, Roxy Morris, with the two wanting to split up Angie and Malcolm. Russell attempted to swing Denise Stapley (who, unbeknownst to both parties, was Malcolm's ally). Matsing would lose a second Immunity Challenge, though by a much smaller margin. At Tribal Council, Russell was once again spared, but decided to vote Roxy with the majority.\n\nAt the third Immunity Challenge on Day 8, Russell struggled to climb up the ladder out of the water, once again putting him in the hot seat against Angie, who also struggled, as Matsing once again lost by a small margin. At Tribal Council, Russell campaigned, saying that he was more dedicated to the game of Survivor and had more experience than Angie. Russell found himself spared again by a 3-1 vote as Angie was sent home.\n\nWith Matsing down to three, Russell was on the outs as he no longer had any allies, nor could he persuade either Denise or Malcolm to turn on each other. Russell tried to find the tribe's Hidden Immunity Idol, but failed to do so under Denise's watchful eye. At the next Immunity Challenge, Matsing lost for the fourth time in a row, causing Russell to snap by smashing the rice pot used in the challenge, telling host Jeff Probst that he wanted to be made of "excellence". Russell believed himself to be the swing vote as Denise and Malcolm plotted against the other, although this was a ruse to blindside Russell. At Matsing's fourth Tribal Council, a shocked Russell was voted out 2-1 and became the fourth person to leave the Philippines, finishing in 15th place.	0	0	15	4	6	5.25	10	0.00

20	John Cochran	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/John_Cochran	2	Cochran returned as a Favorite for Caramoan. In the opening Reward Challenge, he was paired with Francesca Hogi against Fans Matt Bischoff and Laura Alexander. Laura taunted him saying "You think you can handle me?". Cochran retorted saying, "You would be surprised at what I could handle". Francesca scored the point for the Favorites and they eventually won the challenge. After the Favorites (Bikal) got to their camp, Cochran reformed an alliance with Dawn Meehan, promising that he would not betray her again. Over the next few days, Cochran developed a gigantic sunburn, which made him look kind of like a tomato (per the suggestion of his tribe mates saying such a thing, and Brenda Lowe even compared him to a little pregnant lady because of his limitations from the sunburn). At Tribal Council, Cochran and Dawn became the swing votes, since the alliance of Francesca targeted Andrea Boehlke, and Phillip Sheppard's Stealth R Us targeted Francesca. In the end, Cochran and Dawn sided with Phillip's alliance, sending Francesca home 6-4.\n\nAfter Francesca's elimination, the Bikal tribe started dominating challenges. During this time, Phillip dubbed him the "Intelligentsia Attaché". Cochran enjoyed the rewards that Bikal won and overall was just glad to be in the game, stating that "everyday is Wednesday night at 8 pm", referring to when Survivor episodes air on CBS. A minority alliance member, Brandon Hantz became resentful of Phillip. Fearing Brandon's wrath, Bikal requested to go to Tribal Council. An impromptu Tribal Council was facilitated by Jeff Probst in which everyone verbally voted out Brandon unanimously.\n\nOn Day 14, a tribe switch occurred. Cochran stayed on Bikal with Corinne Kaplan, Dawn, and Phillip. The tribe received Fans Julia Landauer, Matt, and Michael Snow, from Gota. The new Bikal was out-muscled by the new Gota and lost. Cochran noticed Matt and Michael's friendship and successfully turned the vote against Matt. Bikal lost the next two challenges because of Phillip. Phillip tried to explain that he threw the challenges, but Cochran saw through his bluff. The Favorites split the votes between Michael and Julia in case one had an idol, but neither had one. Cochran decided to vote out the relatively mundane Julia (who Cochran initially described as "vanilla", but rescinded that comment as it would be "an insult to the vanilla flavor") over Michael and his budding friendship with Corinne.\n\nOn Day 20, the tribes merged and the former Gota moved to Bikal beach. When the first Immunity Challenge was hinted to be a gross food eating contest, Cochran decided this was the challenge for him to win. Cochran barely beat out Malcolm Freberg for individual immunity. Everyone was okay with this as him winning immunity was unlikely. Cochran heard from Dawn that Corinne was planning Phillip's blindside. Cochran relayed the information to Phillip who decided to send Corinne home. Cochran stayed with the Favorites and voted out Corinne. He also followed Andrea's plan to vote off Michael to avoid a Hidden Immunity Idol. Dawn lost her retainer and threatened to pull out of the game unless she found them. Brenda helped Dawn retrieve them, but the incident caused Cochran to view Dawn as volatile. After Reynold Toepfer won immunity, Stealth R Us decided to split the vote between his allies, Eddie Fox and Malcolm. But Malcolm shocked everyone by pulling out two idols and using them, blindsiding Phillip. At the Survivor Auction, Cochran bought a letter from home and more importantly, an advantage at the Immunity Challenge. The advantage was useful as it helped him outlast the physically stronger Eddie, giving him his second individual immunity. After a split vote, Malcolm was voted out for having a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nAt the next Immunity Challenge, Andrea won immunity. Reynold was the intended target, but Andrea started lobbying for Brenda's elimination for she was to easily win if she were to make to the Final Tribal Council. The alliance ultimately split the vote against Eddie and Reynold, resulting in the latter's elimination. Andrea wanted Brenda gone even with Eddie vulnerable. Cochran and Dawn chose to vote against the original target, Eddie. Andrea was blindsided when Sherri Biethman chose to vote her over Brenda and Eddie. Brenda won the Loved Ones Challenge and gave up her and Dawn's right to spend time with their loved ones to the other four. Although he was grateful for having to spend time with his parents, Cochran noted that likability is a liability and deemed Brenda the biggest threat to win the game. Dawn won immunity and Cochran asked her and Sherri to vote Brenda out. Sherri readily agreed but Dawn was conflicted after all Brenda had done for her. In the end, Cochran's plan came to fruition and Brenda was blindsided, leaving her devastated. While returning to camp, Erik Reichenbach collapsed. The medics deemed him unfit to continue, leaving everyone in shock. The Day 37 challenge was changed to a Reward Challenge due to Erik's evacuation. After a long competition, Cochran won the advantage to the Final Immunity Challenge. After the Rites of Passage, the Final Immunity Challenge commenced. Cochran's advantage was that he didn't have to untie any bags of puzzle pieces. Because of that, Cochran had a lead. The lead evaporated when he had trouble with the puzzle, allowing Sherri and Dawn to catch up. Cochran ultimately won the Final Immunity Challenge. After wondering who would be easier to beat, Cochran honored his alliance with Dawn and voted out Eddie.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, most of the jury scolded Sherri for riding coattails and even some of them avoiding talking to her. Dawn, on the other hand, was castigated for her emotional breakdowns and questionable gameplay ethics. Because of the negative attention Sherri and Dawn received, as well as his overall (social, strategic, and challenge) balanced and respected game, the jury gave all of their votes to Cochran, making him the 26th Sole Survivor and the second person to play a "perfect game".	12	0	1	8	9	4.79	39	0.31

18	Dawn Meehan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Dawn_Meehan	2	Dawn was selected to return as a Favorite on Survivor: Caramoan. In the physically brutal opening challenge, she was paired with Erik Reichenbach but lost their round due to a large Shamar Thomas. The rest of Bikal won the challenge and flint with 20 pounds of beans. At camp, two factions emerged, one led by Francesca Hogi and the other led by Phillip Sheppard. Bikal lost the first Immunity Challenge. She and fellow South Pacific alumni and ally, John Cochran found themselves as swing votes. The pair sided with Phillip and his Stealth R Us alliance to vote out Francesca. Brandon Hantz, angry that Francesca was voted out, called the tribe out and berated Dawn so harshly, she broke down crying. Despite that, Bikal started a winning streak, winning five challenges. Dawn enjoyed the luxuries of the consistent victories (fishing gear, comfort items, tarp, rope and a visit from a local tribesman who will teach them who to improve their camp). Problems emerged with Brandon started getting annoyed with Phillip's ego and had violent outbursts such as dumping out the rice. Dawn tried to calm him down but it was no use. At the Immunity Challenge, Bikal was so worried about Brandon hurting them that they asked to go to Tribal Council. After Jeff calmed Brandon down, an Impromptu Tribal Council was held and Brandon was unanimously voted out by a verbal vote.\n\nOn Day 14, a tribal switch occurred. Dawn stayed on Bikal with Cochran, Phillip, and Corinne Kaplan and introduced to Michael Snow, Matt Bischoff, and Julia Landauer. Because the new Gota had all of the athletic people, the new Bikal lost all of the challenges. Dawn agreed with sending Matt home first for his friendship with Michael at Cochran's suggestion. Then she followed Corinne's idea of voting out Julia.\n\nOn Day 20, the new Gota arrived at the Bikal beach for the merge. After the first individual Immunity Challenge, Corinne told Dawn about the plot to eventually blindside Phillip. Not wanting her second season to be a repeat of her first, Dawn decided to relay the information to Cochran, who relayed it to Phillip. Dawn stayed loyal to the Favorites and voted out Corinne for her treachery. Michael was the next to go on Andrea Boehlke's suggestion. While washing her retainer in the Lagoon, her retainer fell into the water. Dawn was very emotional and threatened to pull herself from the game unless she found her retainer. Hearing the commotion, Brenda Lowe decided to help out and found her teeth. Dawn was grateful for Brenda's act of kindness. At the next Reward Challenge, Dawn's team, which consisted of herself, Cochran, Phillip, Erik, and Reynold Toepfer won a reward to a local resort. Dawn washed herself off and enjoyed the last feast of food. Reynold won the next Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council, The alliance planned to split the vote between Malcolm Freberg and Eddie Fox. However, Malcolm shocked everyone when he pulled two idols and used it to void the votes on him and Eddie, sending Phillip to the jury.\n\nA Survivor Auction was held on Day 29. Dawn spent her $500 on a roasted chicken. She regretted it when letters from home were offered. The former alliance stuck together and split the vote between Malcolm and Reynold, and eliminating Malcolm because he brought a clue to the Idol. The women voted out Reynold next. When the last remaining Amigo, Eddie, failed to win immunity, he appeared to be doomed. Andrea, however, had been campaigning for Brenda's elimination for being a jury threat. Dawn and Cochran decided to stick with the original target, Eddie. Andrea was blindsided when Sherri Biethman chose to vote her out over Eddie or Brenda.\n\nBrenda won the Loved Ones Challenge and chose Dawn to share time her husband, David. However, Brenda gave up hers and Dawn's right to spend with their families to the other four castaways. Dawn was very upset with Brenda's decision. At the Immunity Challenge, it came down to Dawn and Brenda. Dawn outlasted Brenda to win immunity. After the challenge, Cochran wanted Brenda gone as a possible threat to win jury votes, and since he also knew Brenda had been plotting with Dawn and Erik to eliminate him. Dawn was hesitant to commit because of all the kindness Brenda had done for her. In the end, Dawn went along with Cochran and Sherri and voted against Brenda, leaving the latter devastated and Erik stunned. While walking back to camp, Erik collapsed. The medics declared Erik unfit to continue and had him pulled out the camp, leaving Dawn shocked and saddened. In the final immunity, Dawn was able to catch up with Cochran despite his advantage he won in the Reward Challenge. In the end, Cochran won the final immunity. He was sure of taking Sherri to the end as the easiest opponent, leaving Dawn in some danger as he and Sherri debated between her and Eddie as the 3rd finalist. Sherri feared Dawn in a final because she thought that she would play the sympathy card to gain votes. Cochran wondered whom would be easier to beat, Dawn or Eddie. Dawn reminded Cochran and Sherri that Eddie had some good friends and sure votes on the jury, particularly Reynold and Malcolm, and would be much more dangerous to Cochran's winning. Cochran agreed, and when the vote came, outsider Eddie was voted out.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Dawn kept a calm and composed demeanor despite receiving the brunt of the jury's criticism. She pleaded her case to the jury, telling them she played more cold-blooded this time around. The jury generally disliked her game on account of her backstabbing and insincerity, as well as her inability to separate emotion from the game. Most memorably, Brenda requested Dawn to take out her retainer, which after an argument Dawn complied. Dawn earned no jury votes and tied with Sherri against Cochran, who won unanimously.	8	0	3	6	7	1.5	39	0.21
12	Malcolm Freberg	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Malcolm_Freberg	3	Malcolm returned as one of ten Favorites that comprised the Bikal tribe. Malcolm was immediately recruited to Phillip Sheppard's second incarnation of the Stealth R Us alliance, along with Andrea Boehlke, John Cochran, Dawn Meehan, and Corinne Kaplan, receiving the codename "The Enforcer". The alliance enjoyed their majority as they voted out Francesca Hogi in a 6-4 vote at the first Tribal Council. As the other Stealth R Us members were developing close relationships, leaving Malcolm and Corrine in the outs, Malcolm and Corinne also developed a close friendship within the alliance, and even found the Hidden Immunity Idol together on Day 4. Malcolm and Corrine's close relationship led the other Stealth R Us members to keep a keen eye on them, targeting Corinne if ever they would lose the Immunity Challenge; however, the Favorites continued to dominate.\n\nBikal enjoyed three consecutive Immunity wins, only losing Brandon Hantz after he had dumped Bikal's rice and beans in a fit of rage after a heated argument with Phillip, which resulted in Bikal's mutual forfeit of Immunity to vote him out.\n\nAfter Brandon's departure, Malcolm (along with Brenda Lowe, Andrea, and Erik Reichenbach) were swapped to Gota where they joined members Eddie Fox, Sherri Biethman, and Reynold Toepfer. On this new tribe, Malcolm enjoyed two more consecutive Immunity wins while being recruited to the Cool Kids Alliance by Reynold, who confessed he had a Hidden Immunity Idol to prove his loyalty.\n\nOn Day 20, the two tribes merged into Enil Edam, a name coined by Malcolm who wanted to name the tribe after his mother, Madeline (Enil Edam is Madeline backwards). Malcolm rejoined with Corinne, with Malcolm telling her he had Eddie, Erik, and Reynold while Corinne said she had Michael Snow. These numbers put them up to six. Corinne, however, was blindsided in a 7-5 vote after Dawn relayed information to Phillip about Corinne's approach to her about the counter alliance.\n\nAt the next Tribal Council, the remaining Cool Kids Alliance Members decided to vote for Andrea, seeing her as a strategic threat. However, a speech given by Phillip at Tribal Council began to unnerve Malcolm, who told Reynold to use his Hidden Immunity Idol on him as he was the one going home. Instead, Michael went home in a 7-3-1 vote after Andrea persuaded Stealth R Us to play it safe after catching wind of her being targeted.\n\nMalcolm continued his luck of finding Hidden Immunity Idols as he found a second one shortly before Tribal Council, which was witnessed by Dawn and Andrea as he found the Idol in front of them. Stealth R Us had no choice but to target Eddie, the only vulnerable member of the Three Amigos. However, at Tribal Council, Stealth R Us was left stunned when Malcolm pulled out two Hidden Immunity Idols, giving one to himself and Eddie. This left Stealth R Us with no choice but to target each other. Stealth R Us stuck to their plan of splitting the votes between Eddie and Malcolm, but after they played the Idols, Phillip left in a 4-0-0 vote.\n\nMalcolm and Reynold decided their best bet was to recruit Sherri and Erik to their alliance, which would give them a 5-4 advantage over the remaining Stealth R Us members. At the Survivor Auction, Malcolm bid $480 on a mystery prize which Malcolm could only view for 60 seconds: it was revealed to be the location of the Hidden Immunity Idol. While going off later that day to find it, Andrea became suspicious and followed Malcolm into the woods to have a standoff so that Malcolm couldn't look for the Idol. Malcolm eventually gave up when he didn't find it. At the Immunity Challenge, Cochran won, and afterwards Malcolm decided to concoct a lie by saying that he had found the Idol. At Tribal Council, Sherri and Erik stayed loyal to Stealth R Us and forced a 3-3-3 tie between Andrea, Malcolm, and Reynold. After realizing that Malcolm did not have the Idol, Malcolm was voted out in a 6-0-0 vote, becoming the third member of the jury.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Malcolm would give his jury vote to John Cochran who would win unanimously 8-0-0 over Dawn and Sherri.	9	3	9	7	8	3.18	30	0.30
11	Phillip Sheppard	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Phillip_Sheppard	2	Phillip returned as one of ten Favorites that comprised the Bikal tribe. Using strategies he had learned from his time as an ally of Rob Mariano in Redemption Island, Phillip formed a second incarnation of Stealth R Us with fellow Redemption Island returnee Andrea Boehlke, Dawn Meehan, Malcolm Freberg, John Cochran, and Corinne Kaplan. This alliance put Phillip's rival Francesca Hogi, Brandon Hantz, Erik Reichenbach, and Brenda Lowe in the minority. Francesca attempted to let Phillip know she was over what happened in their season, but Phillip (who had already buried the hatchet with Francesca) became annoyed with her for being stuck in the past. At the first Tribal Council, Francesca was voted out 6-4 for being a strategic threat.\n\nOver time, Brandon became more annoyed with Phillip for his arrogance, and after Phillip referred to him as "middle management", Brandon told the rest of the tribe that Phillip was the biggest bully he had ever seen. The feud between Brandon and Phillip reached its climax when Brandon dumped Bikal's rice and beans shortly before the fifth Immunity Challenge. Brandon challenged Phillip to fight him, but Phillip ignored him and walked away. At the Immunity Challenge, the tribe mutually agreed to forfeit so they could boot Brandon, which they went through with. Brandon took the time to lash out at Phillip for demeaning the other tribe members with the Stealth R Us codenames before he was unanimously voted out 8-1. After Brandon's departure, The Bikal tribe gained Gota members Michael Snow, Matt Bischoff, and Julia Landauer while Phillip's alliance only lost Malcolm and Andrea.\n\nCorinne's budding friendship with Michael became a concern for Phillip's alliance, but despite this, Michael was spared at the next two Tribal Councils and reached the merge. At the merge, Dawn spilled the beans on the counter alliance that consisted of Eddie Fox, Malcolm, Corinne, Reynold Toepfer, and Michael after they had approached her to join them. Phillip and his alliance voted out Corinne at the following Tribal Council due to her betrayal.\n\nPhillip and Stealth R Us decided to focus on targeting the three stronger males on the outside at the next Tribal Council (Eddie, Malcolm, and Reynold), but once Andrea caught wind of being a target, she became paranoid and the alliance switched it up to Michael just to be safe. With Michael now gone, Phillip and Stealth R Us enjoyed a 7-3 advantage over the alliance of Malcolm, Eddie, and Reynold. At the Immunity Challenge, Phillip sat out voluntarily due to a childhood incident and did not want to be underwater for a long time (oddly enough, Phillip had participated in the previous Immunity Challenge, which was mainly underwater).\n\nThe alliance's target, Reynold, won Immunity and to make matters worse, Malcolm (the next target in line) found Reynold's replanted Hidden Immunity Idol. This left just Eddie vulnerable, but at Tribal Council, Malcolm stunned everyone when he pulled out two Hidden Immunity Idols, giving them to himself and Eddie. Phillip's alliance was forced to target each other but decided to stick with their plan of vote splitting. Phillip became the 10th person voted out of Caramoan and the second jury member when he was voted out in a 4-0 vote due to Eddie and Malcolm playing the Idols.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Phillip "revoked" Sherri's membership from Stealth R Us for riding coattails and chastised Dawn for her constant emotional breakdowns being disruptive at everyday camp life. Phillip praised Cochran for his strategic game. In the end, Phillip voted for Cochran and thanked him for joining Stealth R Us.	7	0	10	4	7	3.3	28	0.25

14	Andrea Boehlke	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Andrea_Boehlke	3	Like fellow Redemption Island returnee Phillip Sheppard, Andrea started the season ready to play a more aggressive game as opposed to merely being a pawn. Andrea and Phillip restarted the Stealth R Us alliance from their original season and managed to vote off past nemesis Francesca Hogi on Day 3 while recruiting Malcolm Freberg, Corinne Kaplan, John Cochran, and Dawn Meehan. Despite having a solid alliance of six, Andrea continued to play a strong strategic game, working on her friendship with volatile outsider Brandon Hantz along with trying to plot a plan to blindside Corinne, whom she didn't trust. Andrea was initially against Phillip giving names to everyone on Bikal (including outsiders Brenda Lowe and Erik Reichenbach) but she didn't really care afterward. She was one of the players most affected by Brandon's outrage, and along with the rest of the tribe voted him off at an impromptu Tribal Council.\n\nAndrea ended up on Gota after the tribe switch and was in the majority along with Brenda, Erik, and Malcolm. Since the new Gota comprised of the stronger players won all the challenges, Andrea was immune until the merge.\n\nUpon the merge, Andrea established a majority alliance consisting of all the Favorites along with a sub-alliance consisting of herself, Cochran, Dawn, and Phillip. When Dawn informed her of Corinne's plan to vote off Phillip in the final eleven vote, Andrea became part of the campaign to vote off Corinne, managing to get potential swing votes Brenda and Erik in on the plan and Corinne was successfully voted off 7-5 on Day 22. Andrea would start to grow closer to Eddie Fox and managed to obtain information from him that she was a target for the next vote. Afraid of being blindsided by a Hidden Immunity Idol, Andrea convinced her alliance of Cochran, Brenda, Dawn, Erik, Phillip, and now Sherri Biethman to vote off Michael Snow to play it safe. An idol would be played for Malcolm that Tribal Council, but it was ineffective as Michael was voted off.\n\nAfter Phillip was blindsided, Andrea stayed loyal to the Stealth R Us remnants to get rid of Malcolm and Reynold Toepfer, going as far as following Malcolm around to prevent him from looking for another idol. However, after Andrea and Brenda's battle in the Immunity Challenge on Day 31, Andrea decided that Brenda was a big threat that needed to go. Erik found a Hidden Immunity Idol using Andrea's clue from the Survivor Auction and gave it to her, which made Andrea feel safe. However, when Andrea brought up blindsiding Brenda along with the fact that she had an idol, this concerned Cochran and Dawn. The Stealth R Us alliance minus Andrea made a plan to split the vote between Andrea and Eddie to get rid of Andrea's idol and they voted her off 3-2-2. Andrea finished in 7th place and became the first woman voted off in possession of an idol.\n\nAndrea proved not to be bitter about her elimination in Ponderosa and at the Final Tribal Council. She asked Cochran to pick an animal that best suits how he played the game and he picked the chameleon. She reassured Dawn that she wasn't upset about how Dawn played the game, saying that she, in fact, was proud of her gameplay. Nonetheless, she joined the entire jury in voting for Cochran to win the title of Sole Survivor.	10	1	7	8	9	2.08	33	0.30

Despite this, he survived the total...	5	1	4	8	5	1.79	38	0.13
6	Brandon Hantz	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Brandon_Hantz	2	Brandon returned for a second time as one of the ten past players comprising the Bikal tribe. Brandon developed a close bond with tribemates Francesca Hogi, Erik Reichenbach, and Brenda Lowe, ultimately joining their alliance. After Bikal lost the first Immunity Challenge, Brandon began to gun for tribemate Andrea Boehlke, believing her to be a dangerous player in the game and believing former South Pacific castmates Dawn Meehan and John Cochran to be on their side. However, that was not the case as his ally Francesca was voted out in a 6-4 vote. Angered by the idea of how cold the majority alliance was for voting out Francesca first for a second time, Brandon flirted with the idea of borrowing some ideas from his uncle Russell Hantz by sabotaging his tribe by, such as urinating on their rice, but managed to restrain himself. Phillip Sheppard, the head of the Stealth R Us alliance, adopted Brandon to his alliance, and like everyone from the alliance, Phillip christened him by giving him his code name, "The Conqueror." Brandon and the rest of the Favorites would remain unbeatable in challenges, winning the next five.\n\nOver the course of his time on the island, he developed a rivalry with Phillip, after the latter referred to him as "middle management." Brandon retaliated by saying that Phillip was the biggest bully he had ever met in front of the other tribe members. On Day 13, the rivalry between the two came to a head when Phillip and Brandon got into an argument following their Reward Challenge win. Brandon apologized to Phillip for losing his cool. However, shortly before the Immunity Challenge, Brandon confronted tribemate Andrea and learned that Phillip was still considering voting him out, despite making amends. Phillip and Brandon got into another argument, resulting in Brandon pouring out Bikal's rice and beans as a way to legitimise his elimination, much to the shock of his tribe mates. Though Erik Reichenbach attempted to take the bag of beans away, he was ignored by Brandon, who began taunting Phillip to fight him as he walked away. Dawn also tried to calm Brandon down, but to no avail.\n\nAppalled by Brandon's mercurial personality, Phillip and the other Favorites leaned towards forfeiting the upcoming Immunity Challenge outright so they can vote Brandon out. At the Immunity Challenge, Brandon launches a tirade against his tribemates, telling the Fans that he was their "second chance" before taking the opportunity to continue bashing Phillip, telling the fans about Stealth R Us and that the code names Phillip had given everyone were demeaning. Brandon also insulted Corinne Kaplan for trying to be nice to the Fans, when they clearly didn't respect them. Jeff Probst called Brandon over to him to cool him down after manifesting intentions to physically harm anyone. However, he got into another argument with Phillip, prompting Jeff to calm him down again. Regardless, Bikal forfeited the challenge anyway, and right there and then, the Favorites verbally voted Brandon out unanimously.	6	0	15	3	2	2.8	13	0.46

1	Francesca Hogi	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Francesca_Hogi	2	Along with nine other favorites, Francesca was placed on the Bikal tribe. She initially aligned with Brenda Lowe, Erik Reichenbach, and Brandon Hantz, and she later apologized to Phillip Sheppard about their rivalry in Redemption Island. Phillip later explained that he will let Francesca be herself and go her own way, despite still being annoyed by her.\n\nAfter Bikal lost the Day 3 Immunity Challenge, the tribe negotiated over whom to send vote out. All of Francesca's alliance wanted to send home her fellow Redemption Island contestant Andrea Boehlke, while the other six Bikal members who hadn't aligned with Francesca wanted to send her home. At Tribal Council, each side of Bikal stated their points including Phillip, who randomly spoke her name angrily three times, proving he actually could pronounce it now. Ultimately, the other Bikal members eliminated Francesca in a 6-4 vote.	1	0	20	6	7	9	3	0.33
9	Corinne Kaplan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Corinne_Kaplan	2	Corinne returned as one of ten Favorites that comprised the Bikal tribe. Almost immediately, Corinne was recruited into Phillip Sheppard's majority Stealth R Us alliance, receiving the code-name "The Dominatrix". Thanks in part to Bikal's limited Tribal Council visits, Corinne formed a friendship with Malcolm Freberg, with whom she found the tribe's Hidden Immunity Idol. However, she also unknowingly attracted the attention of Andrea Boehlke, who found Corinne untrustworthy.\n\nAt the Day 15 tribe switch, Corinne remained on Bikal, with her alliance holding a 4-3 majority over the original fans. Complications quickly arose however, after Corinne began to grow attached to Michael Snow. This soon drove a wedge between Corinne and Phillip, and the two began to consider targeting one another. Despite this friction, Corinne remained loyal to Stealth R Us and helped vote out Matt Bischoff and Julia Landauer at Bikal's next two Tribal Councils.\n\nAfter the two tribes merged into Enil Edam on Day 20, Corinne immediately reconnected with Malcolm, who had forged an alliance with Eddie Fox and Reynold Toepfer. Believing that with the votes of Michael and Erik Reichenbach they could have a group of six, Corinne and Malcolm began to conspire against Phillip. Rather than eliminate him outright though, Corinne and Malcolm decided to target the unaffiliated Sherri Biethman at the first merged Tribal Council, with the intention to vote out Phillip at the Tribal Council after that.\n\nHaving developed a bond with Dawn Meehan during their time at Bikal, Corinne approached her with her plan to defect from Phillip's alliance. Not wanting to repeat the events of her first season, Dawn promptly ratted out Corinne's betrayal to the rest of Stealth R Us. After learning of this, Phillip and Andrea quickly turned the vote onto Corinne, pulling in both Sherri and Erik as numbers. Thus at Tribal Council, Corinne's plan failed and she was blindsided in a 7-5 vote.	6	0	12	7	8	2.75	22	0.27
15	Brenda Lowe	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Brenda_Lowe	2	Brenda began the game on the Bikal tribe along with nine other Favorites. While she initially aligned with Francesca Hogi against Stealth R Us at Bikal's first Tribal Council, Francesca was voted out instead, leaving Brenda in the minority of the tribe. Luckily, Brenda avoided being targeted by the majority alliance and made it to the Tribe Switch on Day 14, where she was switched to the Gota tribe. Since Gota would win the remaining tribal Immunity Challenges, Brenda made the Day 20 merge, becoming a member of the Enil Edam tribe.\n\nDuring this time, Brenda developed a close relationship with Dawn Meehan after she helped Dawn find her lost retainer in the river. She also became an official member of Stealth R Us, helping to eliminate the rival Cool Kids Alliance. Following Reynold Toepfer's elimination, Andrea Boehlke targeted Brenda for her strength in challenges, after Brenda barely lost to her at the Day 31 Immunity Challenge. However, the rest of the tribe felt threatened by Andrea's Hidden Immunity Idol and blindsided her at the following Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 35, Brenda won the Loved Ones Challenge with her father, Raymond, and selected Dawn and her husband to accompany them to a barbecue reward. Surprisingly, Jeff Probst gave Brenda an alternative option where she could give up the reward and time with her loved one (as well as Dawn's) in order for the rest of the tribe to have time with theirs. She chose the latter, pleasing the other contestants, but upsetting Dawn. Thus, at the next Immunity Challenge, Brenda intentionally dropped out so Dawn could win immunity.\n\nAfter returning from the Immunity Challenge, Brenda believed that her alliance would vote out Eddie Fox, the last remaining member of the Cool Kids Alliance. However, John Cochran was intimidated by Brenda's act of selflessness at the Loved Ones Challenge, viewing her as a jury threat. He then persuaded Dawn and Sherri Biethman into voting for Brenda, blindsiding and devastating her in a 3-2-1 vote. On the way out, Brenda remarked that "it hurts" before departing in tears.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Brenda said little to Cochran and Sherri and focused the majority of her speech on Dawn. She brought up the incident where she helped Dawn retrieve her retainer. Brenda asked if had she not been able to return her false teeth, would Dawn have quit the game like she said she would, to which Dawn answered no. Unsatisfied, Brenda ordered Dawn to take out her teeth to prove that being seen without them was not a big deal. Dawn refused at first but eventually gave in, satisfying Brenda, but in the end, Brenda voted Cochran, who would receive all the jury votes to become the Sole Survivor.	11	0	6	8	7	1	36	0.31
16	Erik Reichenbach	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Erik_Reichenbach	2	Erik was placed on the Favorites tribe of Bikal. His tribe won the first Reward Challenge but lost the first Immunity Challenge. At camp, he was angry on how Phillip Sheppard came up to him and said (though worded differently), "You can join us, but if you don't, we already have the numbers, anyway." He sided with Brandon Hantz, Brenda Lowe, and Francesca Hogi in the first Tribal Council, casting his vote for Andrea Boehlke, but since Francesca was voted off 6-4, Erik was left in the minority.\n\nThanks to Brandon's personality and being useful in challenges, Bikal won the next three Immunity Challenges, and after the tribe switch Erik was switched to Gota. Luckily, everybody on Gota were great at challenges aside from Sherri Biethman, and Gota won all of the challenges after the tribe switch.\n\nErik then entered the merge, and was now placed on Enil Edam. Erik's alliance became very successful. Erik won individual immunity on Day 33. Referencing his costly mistake in his first season, Jeff asked him if there's any chance Erik would give up immunity again at Tribal Council, to which Erik replied "I'm way too scared to do that again!". However, Erik did give Andrea the Hidden Immunity Idol after he found it (out of courtesy though, since the clue did belong to Andrea). Furthermore, the idol put a target on Andrea back, setting her up to be blindsided, this time with Erik successfully voting her off after his unsuccessful attempt way back on Day 3. Nearing the end of the game, Erik started to feel extremely hungry, even attempting to climb an extremely tall tree to get coconuts. Tree Mail then came to say that their loved ones were coming, and Erik then began to feel more confident than before. Brenda then won the Loved Ones Challenge and chose Dawn Meehan to enjoy her loved ones time. However, two loved ones were coming and Brenda had to choose between Dawn and her or Erik and the rest of the tribe. However, Brenda chose Erik, Eddie Fox, John Cochran, and Sherri to have time spent with their loved ones. Because of this, Cochran, Sherri, and Dawn chose to blindside Brenda, but Erik stayed loyal to her and voted for Eddie.\n\nAfter that night of Tribal Council, Erik began to feel lightheaded. After the medical team came and said Erik's blood pressure was too low, so he couldn't compete. After a sad elimination, Erik left the game finishing in the same place he ended up in his first season.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Erik commented on how Sherri did not play the game well, and how all of the jury members knew this. They began to argue over the case, so Erik just stopped. Because of that, Erik gave his jury vote to Cochran, just as all the other jurors did.	12	1	5	8	7	1.07	36	0.33

19	Monica Culpepper	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Culpepper	2	Monica returned with her husband, former football player Brad Culpepper. However, the pair was not to play together. Monica was placed on the Galang tribe. In the first Impressions vote, Monica voted against Candice Cody for not knowing much against her. Candice was the first voted out and Rupert Boneham switched places with his wife, Laura Boneham. Galang would generally win challenges over Tadhana. However, all was not peaceful at Galang. Colton Cumbie was trying to create chaos to rule the game and Monica said she didn't know if she could trust him again after he blindsided her in their previous season. The tribe didn't play in to his attempts. This would lead him to quitting at the second Redemption Island duel. Candice told her husband, John Cody to give the clue to Monica. Brad urged Monica to burn the clue, which she obliged. At this point, Monica was in an alliance with Gervase Peterson, Tina Wesson, Aras Baskauskas, and Tyson Apostol. The tribe won the next challenge, but Brad was voted out. Tadhana won their first challenge, sending Galang to Tribal Council. Laura Boneham was the initial target as no one felt comfortable around her. However, Aras wanted to vote out Laura Morett instead knowing she could defeat Brad so Monica's loyalty would be to the alliance. When Laura Morett's name came out as being the one voted out, Monica was worried as she could beat Brad. Nonetheless, Monica joined in voting out Laura M. over Laura B.\n\nMonica's fears was confirmed as Laura M. defeated Brad and he was eliminated. After Brad's elimination, there was a Tribe Switch. Monica stayed on Galang with Tina, Laura B., and Kat Edorsson. Tina's daughter, Katie Collins, and Aras' brother, Vytas Baskauskas came to Galang while Gervase, Aras, and Tyson gone to Tadhana. Galang lost both challenges. Kat was annoyed with Monica's strategizing and talked to Tina about getting her out. Tina alerted Monica and Kat gotten voted out over Vytas. After the second loss, Laura told Vytas that he was next to go. Shocked by her decision, the tribe voted out Laura B. for her unpredictably. After Tribal Council, Monica was told she was number five in the alliance. This worried her.\n\nAt the first re-entry duel, Laura M. returned to the game and burned the clue to the idol. After enjoying the merge feast, Aras decided to target Laura M. again. Meanwhile, Tyson offered Monica to join the Singles Alliance. At the Immunity Challenge, Monica was the first out. Vytas would defeat Aras for immunity. Aras wanted to split the votes between Laura and her daughter, Ciera Eastin. However, Monica would join in the blindside of Aras and he was next to go in a 7-2-2 vote. Monica would defeat Gervase at the next Immunity Challenge. Monica was still paranoid, despite the immunity win. Laura M. scolded Monica for being paranoid, telling her she had immunity and not to worry about being voted out. Monica was assigned with voting against Katie at the next Tribal Council. However, she voted against Vytas, viewing him responsible for Brad being voted out. Neither person had the idol and Vytas was voted out in a 8-1-1 vote. Katie would win the next challenge, however, complicating the next Tribal Council. Tina and Katie told Monica that she was the bottom of the alliance. Tina was voted out in a 7-1-1 without an idol to save her. \n\nMonica won the next Immunity Challenge over Tyson. She also gave up the feast that came with it to her tribe. Laura was unanimously voted out at the vote. Although Katie was the target, Hayden Moss and Caleb Bankston decided to make a move and take out Tyson. Monica outlasted Hayden for her third immunity in the season. Monica would become the swing vote between Ciera and Caleb. She stayed loyal to the alliance and Caleb was sent off to Redemption Island. After the vote, Hayden told everyone that Tyson was going to win the game unless voted out. At the next challenge, Gervase barely beat Monica for the immunity win. However, Gervase picked her and Tyson to join him in the reward. Hayden used this to convince Ciera that she was on the bottom and she flipped. At Tribal Council, Monica was the one getting the votes. The votes were tied, even after a deadlock. The decision went to a rock drawing ceremony. Due to the rules of the rock, Monica was safe. Katie was the one to pick the rock and was sent to Redemption Island. At the next Tribal Council, Monica once again became the swing vote between Gervase and Hayden. After a fierce Tribal Council, the returning players voted out Hayden as Ciera was immune. \n\nAt the final duel, Tina returned into the game. The women started working on Monica to join them. Tyson won the Immunity Challenge. Monica became the swing vote again between the men and the women. After a discussion on who would be better vote out, it was decided it would be more strategic to vote out Ciera over Tina. At Tribal Council, Monica said that she was going to vote for her own game. Tyson gave Gervase the Idol, but it was not needed as Ciera was voted out 3-2. Tina was still working on Monica to force a tie. Tyson won the Final Immunity Challenge. The Men talked about how Monica could win, while Tina tried to force a wedge between herself and Gervase. However, at Tribal Council, Tina was unanimously voted out.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Monica stated in her statement that she did not have blood on her hands. The jury stated that they did not know her. When confronted by this Monica got emotional, especially with Hayden. In the end, Monica only received one jury vote from Vytas for being a strong woman. Tyson would win in a 7-1-0 vote.	7	0	2	7	8	2.43	39	0.18
18	Gervase Peterson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Gervase_Peterson	2	Gervase returned after 13 years, playing the game with with his niece, Marissa Peterson. When the ten pairs of returning players and loved ones joined together at the marooning, Gervase joined the tribe of returning players, Galang, and was part of the majority to vote Candice Cody out on Day 1. At the first challenge of the season, Gervase's performance while swimming was so poor that he needed Aras Baskauskas's help to keep going, putting Galang at a severe disadvantage. The tribe was able to come from behind and win despite this setback; however, this victory was at a price, as Gervase's boisterous cheering was deemed as pouring salt into the losing Tadhana tribe's wounds, and Tadhana sent Marissa to Redemption Island on Day 3.\n\nUpon learning of Marissa being voted out, Gervase felt that Marissa had to play the game on her own and declined to switch places with Marissa at the duel; she was able to escape elimination by finishing second. Redeeming himself from his poor performance in the previous challenge, Gervase did well in the final part of the next Immunity Challenge and was able to win the second challenge for Galang, continuing their winning streak. Like most of his tribe, however, Gervase was getting tired of Colton Cumbie constantly trying to talk strategy, and he joined a majority alliance that included Aras, Monica Culpepper, Tina Wesson, and Tyson Apostol. Gervase bonded with Tyson the most from this group since they often snuck off to eat coconuts in secret (forming their identities as "Coconut Bandits") and since they were the first members of the alliance whose loved ones were eliminated, with Gervase losing Marissa after she lost the duel on Day 9. Galang's winning streak finally came to an end on Day 13, with Gervase joining his alliance in blindsiding Laura Morett in hopes of defeating Brad Culpepper on Redemption Island to secure Monica's loyalty.\n\nWhen host Jeff Probst announced a tribe switch the following day, Gervase and Tyson proceeded with a plan to get the numbers to blindside Aras at the earliest opportunity. With Tadhana stacked with physically-strong men, they won the next two Immunity Challenges, delaying their plans until the merge. After the merge, however, Gervase and Tyson were able to pull in Laura M. (who had returned from Redemption Island), Monica, Caleb Bankston, Ciera Eastin, and Hayden Moss to orchestrate Aras's blindside. This allowed their Singles Alliance to take control of the Kasama tribe, voting out Vytas Baskauskas, Tina, and Laura M. in the next few Tribal Councils.\n\nAlthough Katie Collins, the only member of the tribe remaining who was not part of the alliance, seemed set to go next, Gervase and Tyson were alerted by Ciera that Caleb and Hayden had been plotting to blindside Tyson. Gervase and Tyson countered by pulling in Ciera and Monica to vote out Caleb instead. After Tribal Council, Hayden told the entire Kasama tribe that Tyson would beat any of them if he got to the end. Gervase was very vocal and adamant in his response, saying that he was in control of Tyson (although neither Hayden nor anyone else took him seriously). Gervase's response gave Hayden the feeling that Gervase was open to making a big move, and Hayden proposed they vote Tyson out next. Gervase felt that Tyson was his main ally but that it was good to keep his options open. Caleb called Gervase out at Redemption Island saying that Gervase and Tyson were untrustworthy, but Gervase rejected that by saying they were just able to make the move first. Crucially, Gervase won the next Immunity Challenge on Day 32. At Tribal Council that night, Gervase accidentally dropped major hints that Ciera was the fourth member of the majority alliance, and Gervase was very vocal at that Tribal Council. The initial vote ended in a 3-3 tie and the revote a 2-2 tie, resulting in a deadlock. Since Gervase had individual immunity, he was exempt from the rock drawing tiebreaker, which increased his alliance's odds of a favorable outcome. With Katie drawing the white rock, Gervase and his allies remained in the majority for the rest of the game and he would reach Day 39 with Monica and Tyson.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Gervase's argument as to why he should win was because of how well he was able to adapt to what Survivor has become since his first season, and while the jury felt that he did play well, his gameplay did not stand out as much as Monica's or Tyson's, earning him no jury votes and third place.	7	1	3	7	8	1.79	39	0.18
15	Laura Morett	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Laura_Morett	2	Laura went into the season believing that she and her daughter, Ciera Eastin, were going to have a great experience together, but this turned out to be very wrong as on Day 1, Jeff split the tribes by returning players and their loved ones. Laura was upset she was not able to be at Ciera's side and protect her. During the First Impressions vote, Laura received three votes against her from Candice Cody, Rupert Boneham, and Tyson Apostol, who all voted for her because they claimed they had no knowledge of her gameplay. However, the tables were turned on Candice, who was voted out of the tribe for the same reason, saving Laura from heading to Redemption Island.\n\nOver the next few days, Colton Cumbie started to stir up conflict within the tribe just for his own satisfaction. Like the rest of the women on Galang, Laura had tried to console Colton after he poured out his feelings on Night 1, but after Colton's drama threw the tribe off their game, she didn't have the same feelings. On Day 7, when Galang headed to Redemption Island to witness the duel between Candice, Marissa Peterson, and Rachel Foulger, Colton finally gave up on the game and announced he was quitting. When Jeff asked the tribes about Colton's decision, Laura said that Colton was quitting because strategy was not in Colton's favor. Colton was brought to tears and left the game on Day 7 without competing at Redemption Island. No one at Galang showed any emotion about Colton leaving, including Laura. However, with Colton gone, the alliance of five that excluded Laura became more powerful and the next target was shifted to the two Laura's.\n\nFor the next few days, Galang would be safe as they won many Immunity Challenges, partially thanks to Laura's excellent puzzle-solving skills. Galang's winning streak came to an end when they lost the Day 13 Immunity Challenge, which Laura sat out of. Laura assumed the entire tribe was voting for Laura Boneham, due to not being a returning player, and thought she was in a tight alliance with Aras Baskauskas. However, Aras was actually a part of the Galang majority alliance that consisted of himself, Tina Wesson, Gervase Peterson, Monica Culpepper, and Tyson Apostol. Aras came up with a plan to blindside Laura M. because she would be able to defeat Brad Culpepper (Monica's husband) at Redemption Island, effectively preventing Monica from abandoning the majority alliance if Brad were to return at the merge. The alliance agreed and pulled in outsiders Kat Edorsson and former target Laura B. to vote out Laura M. At Tribal Council, the plan came to life and Laura M. was sent to Redemption Island in a 7-1 vote.\n\nIn her first duel at Redemption Island, Laura came in first place (defeating Brad) and chose to give a Hidden Immunity Clue to Aras' brother, Vytas Baskauskas, who immediately burned it. Afterwards, she would win the next duel and the final duel to reenter the game at the merge.\n\nLaura was originally interested with the idea of forming a "Pairs Alliance" with her daughter as well as Aras, Vytas, Tina, and Katie Collins. However, Aras had other plans in mind, wanting to send her back to Redemption Island. He told the rest of his alliance about his plan to split the votes between herself and her daughter. Tyson, who along with Gervase and Monica had defected, relayed that information back to Laura and offered her a spot in a new alliance he formed. In true karmic fashion, Aras was sent to Redemption Island in a 7-2-2 vote at Tribal Council.\n\nLaura stayed true to her alliance during the next votes, voting off Vytas Baskauskas and Tina Wesson. Laura hit a roadblock in "Big Bad Wolf". Being part of the only pair left in the game, Laura was in trouble, and because she was a bigger physical threat than her daughter, she was the most threatening. She took her daughter's advice to avoid talking strategy with anyone to avoid being targeted. Laura tried to stop Katie Collins from finding the Hidden Immunity Idol by hiding the sharp tools. Ciera pulled Laura aside to have a long talk about where they stood in the game. Ciera told Laura she was planning on voting Laura out to further herself in the game. Laura was disappointed about the fact that Ciera would vote for her, but was extremely proud of Ciera's courage, strength, and determination. After Laura failed to win Immunity, she tried to convince her alliance to stick together and vote out alliance outsider, Katie, but at Tribal Council, Laura's rallying failed and everybody, including Ciera, voted for her, once again sending her to Redemption Island. Ciera hugs her mother apologizing for voting her out and Laura tells her she loves her.\n\nAfter arriving on Redemption Island, Laura decided to trick Tina into pretending to be her daughter Katie by saying "Mom", scaring Tina, but Tina was relieved when she realized it wasn't Katie. Laura had a hard time defining how she felt about Ciera voting for her, but nonetheless she promised to do her best at Redemption Island. Laura stuck true to her promise, coming first in the next Duel. Laura made a game changing move when she told her rival Tina how to complete her puzzle, which lead to Tina overtaking and eliminating Vytas. Laura continued her Redemption Island dominance by coming first in the next two duels, all the while helping Tina stay in the game as well. This resulted in the eliminations of Caleb Bankston and Tina's daughter Katie Collins.\n\nLaura made it all the way to the final Redemption Island duel, which was between herself, Tina, and Hayden Moss. The duel required balance and concentration. Laura initially struggled in the duel, not being able to keep her vase still. After Hayden dropped out, she began to struggle and begged Tina to let her win, but Tina politely declined. Tina remained solid and eventually Laura dropped her vase, eliminating her from the game. Before exiting, Laura was distraught and said that her Redemption Island dominance meant nothing because she was unable to pull off the final win. She thought her daughter, Ciera, would not be proud of her, but Ciera reassured her that she was proud of Laura. Still disappointed, Laura left the game as the sixth jury member finishing in sixth place.\n\nAs a juror, Laura cast her vote for Tyson Apostol to win, which he did in a 7-1-0 vote.	10	0	6	7	6	1.43	36	0.28
6	Brad Culpepper	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Brad_Culpepper	2	Brad entered the game alongside his wife, returning player Monica Culpepper, for Survivor: Blood vs. Water. However, it was announced by host Jeff Probst on Day 1 that it would be Returning Players vs. Loved Ones, separating the married couple. Brad was placed on the Tadhana tribe. In the First Impressions vote, Brad got a vote from Marissa Peterson. However, Laura Boneham was voted out from Tadhana. Rupert Boneham switched with Laura B., transferring her to Galang and him to Redemption Island. Brad immediately gathered the five guys on the tribe, Caleb Bankston, Hayden Moss, John Cody, Vytas Baskauskas, and himself to form a majority alliance. Tadhana initially had the lead at the first Immunity Challenge of the season. The lead was then lost by Katie Collins and Ciera Eastin during the puzzle portion. Gervase Peterson's gloating after the challenge angered Brad causing him to turn the vote against Gervase's niece, Marissa, who was unanimously voted out at the first Tribal Council.\n\nAfter Tadhana again lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 6, the alliance decided to target Rachel Foulger in order to bait her boyfriend, returning player Tyson Apostol, into switching with her. Although John wanted the weaker Ciera gone, Rachel was voted out in a 5-2-1 vote. At the next duel, Brad was confronted by a very angry Tyson and Marissa; Tyson was angry with Brad for voting out Rachel and knew very well why Brad had her voted her out. Marissa was angry with Brad for voting out strong people over the weak, but after he told her that was how the game goes, she snapped and shouted, "F*** you, Brad Culpepper", which promoted her uncle, Gervase, to warn her to tone it down. Colton Cumbie decided to quit and Rachel was eliminated from the game. Candice Cody, who had finished first in both duels, gave her husband, John, a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol both times, with John subsequently sharing the clues with Brad. Tadhana had an early lead at the next Immunity Challenge, but lost yet again, and it was decided that Ciera would go for being useless to the tribe. However, Brad realized that John would listen to Candice if she returned from Redemption Island. This prompted Brad to turn the tribe against John. Despite having reservations, John was blindsided in a unanimous vote.\n\nAt the next duel, Brad again came under fire from both Candice and Marissa for voting out John. John came in first, while Marissa was permanently eliminated from the game. Candice told John to give the clue to Monica, though Brad told his wife to burn the clue, to which she complied. Brad thought about voting out Caleb to avoid the heat at the arena, as Caleb's loved one, Colton, had already quit. Brad was unaware that he was actually at the bottom of his own alliance. Tadhana lost once again due to Ciera's poor performance at the puzzle. Brad talked to the girls about voting Caleb out. However, Brad's alliance was tipped off when he failed to appear for a strategy session. At Tribal Council, Brad said that getting rid of someone without a loved one would be a good idea. This caused Caleb to vote against Brad, forcing a tie. In the revote, Vytas voted against Brad, sending him off to Redemption Island in a 3-1 vote.\n\nCandice was delighted to have Brad on Redemption Island referring to it as "the sweetest voice I ever wanted to hear on Redemption Island" so she could beat him. However, this was not the case. While John came in first place, Brad beat out Candice for second place, eliminating her from the competition. John gave Monica another clue, which she promptly burned. Tadhana won the next challenge. Galang unanimously voted out Ciera's mother, Laura Morett, with the purpose of sending Brad home and securing Monica's loyalty. Laura M. fulfilled her purpose as she and John beat out Brad for first and second place respectively, eliminating him from the game.	1	0	15	7	8	3.33	14	0.07
1	Rupert Boneham	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rupert_Boneham	4	Rupert would play the game for a fourth time with his wife, Laura Boneham. After Laura was the first contestant voted out of the game on Day 1 due to her tribe trying to weaken Rupert, he decided to go to Redemption Island in place of his wife, while Laura took his place on the Galang Tribe. On Redemption Island with Candice Cody, Rupert attempted to preserve his energy by not doing any work, saying he had worked his butt off for his tribe in the past and that's why he didn't have energy for Individual Immunity Challenges. The two were joined by Marissa Peterson on the night of Day 3, and competed in their first duel on Day 4; Candice won coming in first place. Rupert was in second the majority of the way until his stack fell over near the end, allowing Marissa to catch up causing Rupert to come in last place in the duel and be the first person eliminated from the season, placing 20th.	0	0	20	7	5	3.5	4	0.00

20	Tyson Apostol	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tyson_Apostol	4	Tyson once again returned for Survivor: Blood vs. Water to play with his girlfriend, Rachel Foulger. Tyson was initially placed on the Galang tribe with the other returning players. After both tribes were forced to vote somebody out immediately during the First Impressions vote on Day 1, Tyson voted for Laura Morett, but Candice Cody voted out by the majority. Tadhana voted out Laura Boneham, and Rupert Boneham elected to swap places with his wife, resulting in Laura B. joining Galang and both Candice and Rupert being sent to Redemption Island.\n\nIn the first few days, the tribe unified in their distrust towards Colton Cumbie. Tyson formed the Galang Alliance with Tina Wesson, Gervase Peterson, Monica Culpepper, and Aras Baskauskas, which agreed not to discuss any strategy with Colton. Rachel, despite being confident in her ability to play the game on her own, found herself being an outsider against the dominant Five Guys Alliance on Tadhana, although she did seem to have an alliance of her own with John Cody, who was in that alliance. However, Vytas Baskauskas thought that if Rachel was sent to Redemption Island, Tyson would switch places with her, which would weaken Galang, so Rachel was voted out on Day 6. On Day 7, before Rachel, Candice, and Marissa Peterson competed in the duel, Colton quit the game and Tyson called out Brad Culpepper for leading the charge in Rachel's elimination. Tyson was given the opportunity to take Rachel's place and he told Rachel that it was up to her. Rachel assumed that Tyson was in a comfortable position in his tribe and that felt he needed to stay on his tribe, especially since that would foil the reasons why Rachel was voted out in the first place. However, Rachel lost the duel and was eliminated from the game. Even though Rachel reassured him that she enjoyed her time in the game, Tyson was very upset about her losing and felt it necessary to get to the end, otherwise, he would regret not switching with her.\n\nGalang only lost once, on Day 13, after which Tyson and his alliance decided to vote out the fierce challenge competitor Laura M. over the outsider who struggled to fit in, Laura B., hoping that Laura M. would beat Brad on Redemption Island to assure that Monica would trust in them before anyone else. During this time, Tyson grew closer to Gervase as they shared in a secret location where they ate coconuts without the rest of the tribe knowing (referring to themselves as "Coconut Bandits") and Tyson became weary of Aras, who was in control of the alliance and the tribe, and who appeared to be a threat to win. The tribe switch on Day 14 saw Aras, Gervase, and Tyson get switched over to Tadhana where they joined Caleb Bankston, Ciera Eastin, and Hayden Moss. Caleb and Hayden told the returning players about the Hidden Immunity Idol clues, and Tyson managed to get the new players and Gervase to form an alliance against Aras. On Tadhana, Tyson shifted his strategy to focus on making it look like Aras was in control and should be targeted, and by eating as much food as he could.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Kasama tribe on Day 19 following Laura M.'s re-entry to the game, Tyson immediately found the Hidden Immunity Idol using the information he was given earlier by Caleb and Hayden, and Tyson recruited Monica into the plan against blindsiding Aras, and those two, along with post-swap Tadhana and Laura M., successfully blindsided Aras on Day 21, leaving Tina, Vytas, and Katie Collins on the outs. The outsiders were not happy with Tyson, with Tina saying that Tyson had lost their jury votes and both Vytas and Tina voted against Tyson at the Tribal Councils in which they were sent to Redemption Island. With only Katie left, Tyson felt that the last couple left, Ciera and Laura M., needed to be split up as well and led the blindside against Laura M. on Day 26.\n\nAt this point, Tyson felt a bit comfortable, to the point where he opted out of the Day 29 Immunity Challenge to eat instead of competing. Hayden, Katie, and Caleb formed a plan to get rid of Tyson but after telling Ciera, Ciera informed Tyson, which solidified a final four alliance between Tyson, Ciera, Monica, and Gervase. Hayden and Caleb found out that Ciera told Tyson the plan so they tried to convince Tyson to vote out Ciera, but Tyson decided he trusted Caleb and Hayden less and opted to vote out Caleb, viewing him as a likely candidate to win the jury vote. Tyson did not feel comfortable going into that vote so he decided to play his Hidden Immunity Idol, but he ended up wasting it.\n\nAfter wasting his idol and Hayden announcing to the tribe that Tyson would beat any of them in the final three, Tyson felt uneasy about where he stood in the game. Luckily for him, Laura M. won the duel on Day 30 and gave a clue to the location of the re-hidden idol to Ciera, who shared the information with Tyson. Tyson found the Hidden Immunity Idol and was relieved again, saying, "Now, I can take a nap. I wasn't going to be able to nap unless I found that idol." However, at the Day 32 Tribal Council, all the drama that came out of the conversation convinced Ciera to renege her alliance with Tyson, Monica, and Gervase, forcing a 3-3 initial vote and a 2-2 revote. Tyson, Ciera, and Katie were forced to draw rocks, and Katie drew the white rock, sending her out of the game. Tyson hugged her on the way out, complimenting her on making a bold move, but then Tyson's trademark "sarcastic jerk" side showed when he followed that up with, "that's your seat over there" as he pointed towards the jury section.\n\nDespite many attempts to convince Monica that she needed to make a big move against Tyson, the alliance of Tyson, Monica, and Gervase stayed strong for the remainder of the game, voting out Hayden, Ciera, and Tina (who came back from Redemption Island on Day 36). Tyson also won the last two individual Immunity Challenges, though Monica was upset with Tyson when he used his idol on Gervase at the Day 37 Tribal Council since it showed a lack of trust in her.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Tyson explained that he did not play with any malice and that he just wanted to play hard and avenge Rachel's elimination. He also apologized to Katie for the rude comment he made to her. Due to his intentions for playing the game the way he did, being in control most of the time, and playing hard, the entire jury aside from Vytas voted for Tyson to win the title of Sole Survivor over Monica and Gervase, who finished in second and third place respectively.	8	2	1	8	9	3.43	39	0.21

11	Vytas Baskauskas	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Vytas_Baskauskas	2	Assigned to Tadhana, the loved ones' tribe, Vytas joined the Five Guys Alliance led by Brad and in doing so ensured his safety for a short time. After losing the second Immunity Challenge, Vytas and the alliance opted to send a message to the returning players by eliminating their strongest player (Tyson)'s loved one, Rachel Foulger, in an attempt to see them swap at Redemption Island, though this plan fell short when Tyson did not take the bait. Consecutive losses at future challenges and Brad's efforts to eliminate those without loved ones caused an uprising in the tribe when Caleb Bankston openly admitted his intention to vote out Brad. When the vote tied during the episode "One Armed Dude and Three Moms", Vytas flipped on his alliance, sending the former NFL player to Redemption Island.\n\nWhen the tribes switched, Vytas found himself the only male on a female governed Galang tribe and despite best efforts, he was the outsider. Losing the next two challenges, Vytas was spared when Kat Edorsson wanted to target Monica Culpepper and when Laura Boneham declared her intention to vote with the rest of the women and send him to Redemption Island. He was spared as Kat was deemed untrustworthy and Laura was deemed too much of a wildcard as they were eliminated instead.\n\nAfter the tribe merge, Vytas reunited with his brother and immediately sought power, though it was short-lived when Aras was blindsided and after attempting to scramble for votes to stay in "My Brother's Keeper", he was subsequently voted out. Vytas survived one duel before being eliminated by the duo of Tina Wesson and Laura Morett after Laura came in first place and helped Tina come in second place.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Vytas told Tyson he was not getting his vote and told Gervase Peterson that playing "Old School" meant that he was not adapting to the game. He was the only juror to give his vote to Monica, who lost to Tyson in a 7-1-0 vote.	3	0	10	7	6	3.18	27	0.11

16	Ciera Eastin	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ciera_Eastin	3	Ciera entered the game with her mother, Laura Morett. She was placed on the Tadhana tribe with the other loved ones of the returning players. Ciera formed a friendship with Katie Collins, and the two always seemed to be in danger of elimination on pre-switch Tadhana due to the emergence of an all-men alliance led by Brad Culpepper. However, they survived and made it to the merge unscathed, in Ciera's case in large part due to Caleb Bankston flipping his vote at the fourth Tadhana Tribal Council.\n\nAfter Ciera's mom, Laura, returned from Redemption Island and rejoined her at the merge, Ciera and Laura allied with Tyson Apostol, Gervase Peterson, Monica Culpepper, Hayden Moss, and Caleb to counter the strong couples alliance made of Aras Baskauskas, Vytas Baskauskas, Tina Wesson, and her former ally Katie. The alliance of seven successfully voted out Aras, Vytas, and Tina. Then, Ciera made the tough decision to vote out her own mother in order to prevent the two of them being seen as threats and eliminated one after the other. She then allied with Tyson, Gervase, and Monica to vote off Caleb, rather than side with the former Tadhana tribe.\n\nAt the final six Tribal Council, Hayden made it clear to Ciera that she was number four in the alliance she was in, and that she should take a risk and draw rocks. She decided to risk her game and drew rocks with Katie and Tyson. Unfortunately for her, her ally Katie chose the wrong rock and was promptly eliminated. Ciera won the next Immunity Challenge, saving herself temporarily. Hayden was sent to Redemption Island instead of her, and Tina returned and became her closest ally. The two tried to convince Monica to flip on her alliance and go the Final Three but to no avail. Ciera was voted out over Tina for being a bigger threat, placing 5th overall.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Ciera voted for Tyson to win over Monica and Gervase, making him the Sole Survivor in a 7-1-0 vote.	4	0	5	8	9	3.29	37	0.11
7	Kat Edorsson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kat_Edorsson	2	Kat entered the game with her boyfriend and former Big Brother winner Hayden Moss. She was placed on Galang along with the other returning players, while Hayden was placed on Tadhana. Although Galang won the first four Immunity Challenges, drama did stir up when Colton Cumbie started to spread rumors that Kat and Tina Wesson had a conflict. Luckily for Kat, the tribe did not believe his lie and she remained safe for the first ten days.\n\nAt the Day 14 Tribe Switch, Kat remained on Galang. Despite all of the Galang women agreeing to remain allied and vote off Vytas Baskauskas, Kat grew annoyed with Monica Culpepper's frequent talk of strategy and pondered voting her out over Vytas. She voiced her plan to Tina, who immediately alerted Monica. Upon being confronted by Monica, Kat denied ever plotting against her, even though Monica knew she was lying. Upset by Kat's betrayal, Monica convinced the rest of the tribe to vote her off instead of Vytas, and despite Kat's best efforts to save herself, she was sent to Redemption Island in a unanimous 5-1 vote.\n\nBefore her duel began the next day, Kat begged Hayden to take her spot on Redemption Island, but he declined, telling Kat that he had a better chance of winning the game then she did and she tearfully agreed. Though Kat started off in the duel well, John Cody and Laura Morett both pulled ahead and beat her for 1st and 2nd place respectively, permanently eliminating Kat from the game.	4	0	14	4	3	1.57	17	0.24
17	Tina Wesson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tina_Wesson	3	Although Tina came into the game with her daughter Katie Collins as part of the Blood vs. Water twist, host Jeff Probst shocked the castaways on Day 1 when he revealed that the loved ones would be split into separate tribes. Tina was placed on the Galang tribe, which consisted of ten returning castaways. At the First Impressions vote immediately after, Tina joined the majority in sending Candice Cody to Redemption Island. However, her tribemate Rupert Boneham decided to go to Redemption Island in place of his wife Laura Boneham, so Laura B. joined Galang in his place. On Day 5, she became part of the Galang Alliance led by Aras Baskauskas. When Galang finally lost immunity on Day 13, Tina joined the majority in blindsiding Laura Morett.\n\nTina, along with Monica Culpepper, Kat Edorsson, and Laura B. remained on Galang after the tribe switch. They were joined by Tadhana members Katie and Vytas Baskauskas. When Galang lost immunity, it appeared that Vytas who was the only male member on Galang would be the target. However, after Kat said she wanted Monica out, Tina questioned her loyalty and told Monica. At Tribal Council, Tina joined the majority in blindsiding Kat. When Galang lost immunity again, it appeared Vytas would be the target. However, Laura B.'s decision to tell Vytas he was the target made Tina and the other women wary of her. Consequentially, Tina joined the majority in blindsiding Laura B.\n\nThe tribes then merged into the Kasama tribe on Day 19, along with Laura M., who won her way back from Redemption Island. After the first individual Immunity Challenge, Aras suggested that they split their votes between Laura M. and her daughter Ciera Eastin, with Tina, Katie, and Vytas on board. However, Tyson Apostol rallied the others against Aras. Tina voted for Ciera at Tribal Council, but Aras was blindsided. Upon returning to camp after the vote, Tina called out Monica and Tyson for the blindside, but several of the tribe members defended themselves by telling Tina that Aras had several alliances. At the next Tribal Council, Tina joined the majority in voting out Vytas. Tina was voted out in a 7-1-1 vote at the following Tribal Council, and was sent to Redemption Island.\n\nOn Redemption Island, Tina managed to win or come in second in all the duels, eliminating her daughter along the way. After winning the final duel, she returned to the game. At camp, Tina and Ciera tried to convince Monica to side with them. Tina and Ciera voted for Gervase Peterson at Tribal Council, but Monica stayed loyal to Gervase and Tyson, who played a Hidden Immunity Idol on Gervase, so Ciera was voted out, leaving Tina on the outs. After Tyson won the Final Immunity Challenge, Tina tried to convince Monica that she should make a big move and vote for Gervase, forcing a fire-making tiebreaker, but Monica decided to stick to her original alliance and Tina became the last member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Tina asked the finalists to pick one word to describe themselves. Tina was one of the seven jurors who voted for Tyson to win.	9	0	4	7	8	1.79	38	0.24
10	Aras Baskauskas	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Aras_Baskauskas	2	Aras returned to Survivor with his older brother Vytas Baskauskas, whom he had a long-standing rivalry with. As with the other returning players, Aras was assigned to the Galang tribe, while Vytas was placed on the Tadhana tribe. Aras lamented the tension between him and his brother, with Aras being the congenial, more popular brother who wanted to look after his older brother who was battling heroin addiction.\n\nThe brother's conflict spilled over in challenges, with Aras defeating Vytas in the first four Immunity Challenges, even after Vytas taking cheap shots at him. However, Aras's tribe prevailed, winning the first four Immunity Challenges. During this time Aras also formed the Galang Alliance which consisted of himself, Gervase Peterson, Tyson Apostol, Monica Culpepper, and Tina Wesson.\n\nWhen Galang finally lost immunity on Day 13, it appeared Laura Boneham would be the target for being the outsider, but Aras suggested they target Laura Morett because she would defeat Brad Culpepper at the next Redemption Island duel which would keep Monica on their side. Aras's plans came into fruition, with Laura M. sent to Redemption Island and eventually defeating Brad. Returning from Tribal Council, Tyson and Gervase began to question Aras's influence in the tribe.\n\nA Day 14 tribe switch sent Aras along with Tyson and Gervase to Tadhana where they joined original Tadhana members Ciera Eastin, Hayden Moss, and Caleb Bankston. Tadhana won the next Immunity Challenge. The next day, Tyson rallied the rest of the tribe against Aras. However, Aras was spared when Tadhana won immunity again.\n\nAras reached the merge, where he was reunited with his brother Vytas, and both Vytas and Katie Collins joined his alliance. He talked to his alliance about targeting Laura or Ciera. After the Immunity Challenge, Aras suggested they split their votes between Laura and Ciera in case a Hidden Immunity Idol was in play. Tina, Katie, and Vytas were on his side, but Tyson successfully turned everyone else on Aras. At Tribal Council, Aras was blindsided in a 7-2-2 vote with Aras and Vytas voting for Laura, and Tina and Katie voting for Ciera. He was sent to Redemption Island. Vytas was sent to Redemption Island next, so Aras was reunited with his brother again. Aras lost the duel to Vytas and Tina, so he was eliminated from the game in 11th place, and he became the first member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Aras asked the Final Three about whom they felt he should vote for if not themselves. Aras contributed to Tyson's 7-1-0 victory.	6	0	11	7	8	2	25	0.24
2	Colton Cumbie	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Colton_Cumbie	2	Colton entered the game on the Galang tribe, who generally dominated in challenges. When Jeff announced that the returnees would be playing against their loved ones, Colton was visibly upset. For the first day, Colton tried to sell his new "change of personality" from his previous season. However, Colton became frustrated with the tribe's peacefulness, stating that "they should be playing Survivor!". Colton tried to create chaos in the tribe, by backstabbing everyone and creating fake alliances. Colton was caught in his actions, and this formed the 5-person alliance of Tyson Apostol, Aras Baskauskas, Gervase Peterson, Tina Wesson, and Monica Culpepper. Over the course of the next few days, the game started drifting from Colton's grasp, and he felt like an outcast. On Day 7, when Galang headed to Redemption Island to witness the duel between Candice Cody, Marissa Peterson, and Rachel Foulger, Colton decided to quit the game because he was depressed he wasn't with his partner, Caleb Bankston, and he just felt that he had no shot at winning due to being on the outs of his tribe and nobody wanting to talk strategy with him. Denying the tribe the satisfaction of getting him voted out, Colton left the game for good.	2	0	19	2	3	5	7	0.29
5	Candice Cody	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Candice_Cody	3	Candice went on to play for a third time in Survivor: Blood vs. Water with her loved one and husband, John Cody. As she was a returning player, she joined the Galang tribe. At the First Impressions vote, she voted for Laura Morett because she did not know anything about her; however, the majority of the tribe voted out Candice for the same reason, sending her to Redemption Island. John, her loved one, was offered a chance to take her place, but Candice wanted John to experience the game as she had already played twice before and chose to stay on Redemption Island.\n\nAt the first Redemption Island duel, Candice and Rupert Boneham (who had taken his wife's place on Redemption Island) competed against Marissa Peterson. Candice won, and gave a clue to the whereabouts of the Tadhana Hidden Immunity Idol to John, while Marissa came in second place, eliminating Rupert. Candice and Marissa next competed against Rachel Foulger, and, while Rachel was eliminated, Candice won and chose to give a second idol clue to John.\n\nOn Night 8, John was voted out of Tadhana, joining Candice and Marissa on Redemption Island. At the arena the following day, Candice made several negative comments towards Brad Culpepper, who she deemed responsible for John's elimination. After both she and John survived the duel, Candice instructed John to give the clue to Brad's wife, Monica Culpepper, in an attempt to paint a target on her. However, Monica chose to publicly burn the clue at the arena instead. On Night 10, Brad was voted out and joined Candice and John on Redemption Island, much to her delight. At her fourth duel on Day 11, Candice competed against John and Brad, but narrowly lost to the latter, permanently eliminating her.	3	0	16	6	7	1.6	11	0.27

18	Tony Vlachos	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tony_Vlachos	3	Tony was initially placed on Aparri, the Brawn tribe of Cagayan. While in the woods, fellow police officer Sarah Lacina looked him in the eyes and asked if he was a cop, though he lied and said no. She told him she could tell because she too was a cop. Soon after, he admitted to her that he was a cop and they bonded and formed an alliance called "Cops-R-Us". Tony spent the first few days building a "spy shack," finding a Hidden Immunity Idol, and forming alliances with both Sarah and Trish Hegarty. He also harbored some resentment towards Cliff Robinson for his popularity within the tribe. Tony lied to Sarah, saying that Cliff and Lindsey Ogle were gunning for her successfully manipulating her against her initial alliance. Sarah then convinced Trish and Woo Hwang to come into their alliance and throw the fourth Immunity Challenge to vote Cliff out, followed by Lindsey. Tony, along with Lindsey, sat out of the challenge while the others (except for Cliff) attempted to throw the challenge. Cliff, however, single-handedly saved himself by winning the challenge for Aparri. Due to their challenge prowess, Aparri never attended Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 12, a Tribe Switch occurred, sending all of Aparri's members, with the exception of Sarah, to the new Solana tribe, along with original members Jefra Bland and LJ McKanas. After Solana lost the next Immunity Challenge, the former Aparri members were set to vote LJ out, though Trish, who had bonded with LJ, attempted to get Tony to vote Cliff out instead. At Tribal Council, Tony and Trish joined LJ and Jefra in blindsiding Cliff. Upon returning to camp, Trish and Lindsey got into a heated argument, resulting in Lindsey quitting the game. Tony was happy with this development.\n\nAfter winning the next Reward Challenge, Solana won the right to raid Aparri's camp. The tribe sent Tony and Woo to conduct the raid, with the two also receiving a clue for a Hidden Immunity Idol at the Solana camp. Tony, however, thought of using this clue in order to target Aparri's strongest member, Jeremiah Wood. He claimed in front of the other tribe to have been instructed to give a clue to a Hidden Immunity Idol to a member of Aparri and gave it to Jeremiah. The plan, though, did not work because Jeremiah immediately recognized that it was the same clue that the original Solana tribe had received prior to the tribe switch, though it managed to cast suspicion on Jeremiah.\n\nTony made it to the merge on Day 17 and became part of the merged tribe, Solarrion. Being down in numbers, the new Solana Alliance needed Sarah's vote, but Sarah overheard her former allies Tony, Trish, and Woo yell "Top 5!" along with Jefra and LJ at the previous challenge, which made her feel excluded. Tony tried to pull Sarah back into their alliance, seemingly to no avail, as Sarah was committed to staying with the opposing Aparri Alliance. Trish saw an opportunity to swing Kass McQuillen, who was bickering with Sarah, by offering to vote Sarah out should Kass join them. A hesitant Tony eventually agreed to target Sarah after recognising that he had not succeeded in flipping her after she refused to swear on her badge. At Tribal Council, Tony and LJ made a grand stand by playing their Hidden Immunity Idols for each other, though this was all for naught as the Aparri Alliance had actually targeted Jefra. Kass, however, decided to flip and Sarah became the first member of the jury.\n\nAt the next Tribal Council Tony suggested voting out Morgan McLeod as due to her laziness she was the least likely to have an idol. His alliance agreed and Morgan was voted out. Though now in a position of power, Tony found himself to be increasingly paranoid after the Aparri Alliance voted for him at the following Tribal Council where Morgan was voted out. Tony decided to target LJ as he believed LJ was the biggest strategic threat in the game. Tony decided to play up his paranoia and suggested voting out Woo to LJ, following this Tony then framed him by claiming that LJ wanted to vote Woo out. Tony then told Trish that LJ was sketchy and untrustworthy but Trish dismissed this as Tony being paranoid. The team of Tony, Jeremiah, and Spencer Bledsoe won the next Reward Challenge, and Tony used this opportunity to try to use their alliance's votes. Tony then told Woo that LJ had been targeting him getting Woo on board to target LJ. At the next Tribal Council, Tony and Woo joined the Aparri Alliance in blindsiding LJ, much to Trish's shock.\n\nThe following day, Jefra began to feel insecure about Tony's deception towards everybody and confronted Trish to try to gun for him. Trish and Kass, however, were able to assuage Jefra's fears and pull her back into their alliance. Trish also had Tony reassure Jefra himself, which he did by swearing on his family members. It was also at this time that Tony's paranoia led to him finding a Hidden Immunity Idol with "special powers."\n\nThe alliance came back together and decided to target Jeremiah as they believed Spencer had the idol and would be more likely to play it for himself. This proved to be correct as Spencer did have an idol but played it for his own safety with Jeremiah going home. While Spencer played his idol, Tony bluffed using an apparently fake idol in order to ensure that he played it on himself rather than Jeremiah.\n\nAt the Survivor Auction, Tony, along with Spencer and Tasha Fox held out on buying any food, anticipating that there would be an advantage offered and feared that either Spencer or Tasha would get it. When an advantage was indeed offered, Tasha backed out while both Tony and Spencer bid the maximum amount of $500 for a chance to draw rocks to win the advantage. Tony won the advantage, which turned out to be a clue to another Hidden Immunity Idol, which he also found. At the same time, Tony began to fear the possibility of a women's alliance forming between the remaining women, who had outnumbered the remaining men in the game. Tony and Woo again struck a deal with Tasha and Spencer, and they blindsided Jefra at the next Tribal Council.\n\nThe next morning, Kass, fed up with Tony's double-dealing, got into an argument with Tony, in which Tony revealed that he had the Hidden Immunity Idol with "special powers." This led to Kass, Tasha, Spencer, and Woo plotting to flush Tony's Hidden Immunity Idol, though Kass later changed her mind, instead wanting to face Tony at the Final Tribal Council due to her perceiving him as an easily beatable Hantzian jury goat. At Tribal Council, she and Woo rejoined Tony and Trish and sent Tasha to the jury.\n\nWoo then revealed to Tony the next day that he and Kass had conspired against him the previous night. Tony confronted Kass about this, but later claimed to forgive her, stating that he planned on going to the end with her and Trish. Unsatisfied, Kass revealed this to Woo, which made Woo question his own loyalty to Tony. After Tony won the next Reward Challenge and picked Trish to share his reward with, Kass, Spencer, and Woo plotted to split the pair up. At Tribal Council, Tony revealed that he actually had two Hidden Immunity Idols in his possession. He played the regular one for himself and proceeded to join the rest of the tribe in blindsiding his ally Trish.\n\nAlthough the Hidden Immunity Idol with "special powers" expired at the final five, Tony bluffed by claiming that it could be used until the final four. The remaining castaways were then surprised by a visit from their loved ones. Although Tony was glad that his friend, Arnold, visited him, he was upset that his wife, Marissa, could not come as she was taking care of their baby girl. After Kass won the next Immunity Challenge, Spencer came up to Tony and told him that he believed that there would be a Final Two. Spencer claimed that if either Kass or Woo won, they would take each other to the end. If Tony voted Woo out and Spencer won, he would take Tony. Unconvinced by Spencer's argument, Tony joined Kass and Woo in voting him out at Tribal Counci due to him being a big jury threat.\n\nUpon returning to camp, Kass and Woo agreed that voting Tony out was both in their best interests and agreed to take each other to the end. At the Final Immunity Challenge, Woo narrowly beat Kass by half a second to win immunity. Back at camp, both Tony and Kass pleaded with Woo, with Tony appealing to Woo's sense of honor, pointing out that the jury would see him as being disloyal if he voted Tony out. At Tribal Council, Woo shocked everyone by voting Kass out, making her the ninth and final member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, the jury scolded Tony. He was confronted by Sarah for swearing on his badge and by Jeremiah for swearing on his family. He was also confronted by LJ and Jefra for his blindsiding both of them. He was then lambasted by a furious Trish for swearing on his late father's grave, then proceeding to blindside her. In spite of this, Morgan and Spencer both lauded Tony for his control of the game. In the end, Tony received eight jury votes to Woo's one (from Tasha), earning him the title of Sole Survivor of Survivor: Cagayan.	10	3	1	7	9	6.93	39	0.26

8	Sarah Lacina	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sarah_Lacina	3	Sarah was initially placed on the Aparri tribe of Brawns on Survivor: Cagayan. While in the woods, Sarah interrogated fellow police officer Tony Vlachos, asking if he was a cop. He lied to her, saying no, but Sarah did not believe this as she is also a cop. After some time, Tony decided to tell the truth. They bonded and formed an alliance called "Cops-R-Us". However, Tony lied once again to Sarah, claiming that Cliff Robinson and Lindsey Ogle were gunning for her. Sarah and Tony convinced Trish Hegarty and Woo Hwang to come into their alliance and throw the upcoming Immunity Challenge to vote Cliff out, who would then be followed by Lindsey. At the Immunity Challenge on Day 11, Solana easily came in first place. Despite Sarah, Trish, and Woo attempting to throw the challenge, Cliff single-handedly saved himself by winning the challenge for them, coming in second place, continuing their winning streak, and did not have to attend a Tribal Council. Though she was disappointed that Cliff was still in the game, Sarah showed no remorse for rival tribe Luzon and said they deserved to lose after their terrible performance.\n\nAt the tribe switch on Day 12, Sarah was left as the only remaining Brawn still on Aparri, as all her tribemates had been swapped to Solana. On Day 15, Sarah was thrilled when host Jeff Probst told her tribe that Cliff and Lindsey had both been eliminated the night before, Cliff at Tribal Council, and Lindsey quitting afterwards. When the Aparri tribe lost the subsequent Immunity Challenge, Tony yelled "top five!" while celebrating victory with the Solana tribe, which made Sarah feel excluded. At Sarah's first Tribal Council, she joined Brains Kass McQuillen, Spencer Bledsoe, and Tasha Fox, as well as Beauty Morgan McLeod in deciding the fate of the other Beauties, Alexis Maxwell and Jeremiah Wood. They voted Alexis out, fearing she would reconnect with her old allies at the merge.\n\nThe tribes merged into the Solarrion tribe on Day 17. Sarah found herself the swing vote between both tribes. At first, Sarah wanted to stick with the Aparri Alliance, but Kass questioned her loyalty, which made Sarah feel insecure. Tony tried to make Sarah swear to side back with his Solana Alliance, though she could not. Kass continued to argue with Sarah, which Trish saw as an opportunity. Kass and Tasha asked Sarah if she was willing to send home Trish or Jefra Bland, which Sarah refused as she would rather target a strong male who could possibly have a Hidden Immunity Idol such as Tony or LJ McKanas. Trish and Tony realized that Sarah was no longer on their side and Trish went to talk to Kass to convince her to go with the Solana Alliance instead. At Tribal Council, the new Aparri voted for Jefra, while all of the new Solana voted for Sarah. Kass flipped on her alliance and voted for Sarah, sending her home as the first jury member and in 11th place.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Sarah congratulated the finalists. Sarah called out Tony for breaking their promise to not vote each other out. Sarah then asked Woo if he would vote for her if she played the same game as Tony did. Woo said if she did it without the idols, he would vote for her. Despite liking Woo and being angry with Tony, Sarah voted for the latter to become the Sole Survivor, contributing to his victory in an 8-1 vote.	6	0	11	7	8	3.71	19	0.32

17	Woo Hwang	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Woo_Hwang	2	Woo was placed on Aparri, the Brawn tribe of Cagayan. An avid basketball fan and card collector, Woo immediately recognized former NBA player Cliff Robinson, whom he proceeded to align with. The tribe proved to be successful in the beginning, winning every single challenge prior to the swap. When Tony Vlachos lied to Sarah Lacina by saying that Cliff and Lindsey Ogle were gunning for her, Sarah convinced Woo and Trish Hegarty to come into their alliance and throw the upcoming Immunity Challenge to vote Cliff out, followed by Lindsey. Cliff, however, single-handedly saved himself by winning the challenge for Aparri despite Sarah, Trish, and Woo's attempts to throw the challenge.\n\nAt the tribe switch, all the Aparri members other than Sarah were switched to the new Solana tribe with original members Jefra Bland and LJ McKanas. After losing the next Immunity Challenge, the original Aparri members agreed to vote out LJ. Trish, however, had bonded with LJ and, after managing to pull in Tony, joined LJ and Jefra in blindsiding Cliff. Upon returning to camp, Trish and Lindsey then got into a heated argument, which resulted in Lindsey quitting the game and leaving Woo firmly on the outs.\n\nSolana won the next Immunity Challenge, allowing Woo to make it to the merge and became part of the merged tribe, Solarrion. Being down in numbers, the new Solana Alliance needed Sarah's vote, but Sarah overheard her former allies (along with Jefra and LJ) yell "Top 5!" at the previous challenge, which made her feel excluded. Woo won the first individual Immunity Challenge, but his alliance was still down in numbers. Trish saw an opportunity when she noticed Kass McQuillen's continued arguments with Sarah. At Tribal Council, Kass flipped from the Aparri Alliance and voted out Sarah, who became the first member of the jury.\n\nAfter being part of the winning team at the next Reward Challenge, Spencer Bledsoe retrieved a clue to a Hidden Immunity Idol and took it back to camp with him. While by a stream, Spencer was spotted by Woo, who picked up his pants from the ground, resulting in the clue falling out. Woo spotted this and immediately picked it up and quickly sprinted back to camp to share it with everybody in his alliance which angered Spencer. This sparked a massive hunt for the Hidden Immunity Idol, which was ultimately found by Spencer.\n\nAfter LJ was blindsided by Tony and Woo, Jefra felt insecure about Tony's deception towards everybody and confronted Trish to try to gun for him. Trish and Kass, however, were able to assuage Jefra's fears and pull her back into their alliance. Several days later, however, Tony and Woo began to fear the possibility of an alliance forming between the remaining women and decided to blindside Jefra.\n\nThe team of Woo, Kass, and Spencer then won the next Reward Challenge, where Kass and Spencer tried to convince Woo to vote with them and Tasha Fox in flushing one of Tony's Hidden Immunity Idols. Though hesitant, Woo agreed to the plan but was later approached by Kass, who had changed her mind. At Tribal Council, Kass and Woo stuck with Tony and Trish, sending Tasha to the jury.\n\nThe following morning, Woo confessed to Tony that he had considered aligning with the Aparri Alliance the previous night, noting that Kass was also in on the plan. Tony later confronted Kass, though he claimed to forgive her and noted that he planned on going to the end with her and Trish. Kass, unsatisfied by this, revealed this to Woo, causing him to doubt his own alliance with Tony. This angered Tony, and led to Kass plotting with Spencer and Woo to break up the pair of Tony and Trish. At Tribal Council, Woo reflected on his position on the tribe as the "foreign exchange student" within the dysfunctional personalities that remained in the game. At the vote, Woo and Tony joined Kass and Spencer in blindsiding Trish.\n\nThe next day, the Final Four were surprised when they were visited by their loved ones, including Woo's cousin. After failing to win the next Immunity Challenge, Spencer decided to scramble because he felt insecure about his position. Spencer took Tony out to the woods to explain his theory that there would be a Final Two and whoever won the next challenge would choose somebody to be in the other position. Spencer claimed that if either Kass or Woo win, they would take each other to the end. If Tony vote Woo out and Spencer won the following Immunity Challenge, he would take Tony with him. Tony, however, decided to stick with his alliance and voted Spencer out at Tribal Council.\n\nWoo and Kass agreed that voting Tony out next would be in their best interests and agreed to take each other to the end. After Woo narrowly defeated Kass to win the Final Immunity Challenge, both Tony and Kass made their case to Woo. Tony appealed to Woo's sense of honor, pointing out that the jury would see him as being disloyal if he voted Tony out. Kass, on the other hand, stressed her being less than popular with the jury after her move at the merge. At Tribal Council, Woo shocked everyone when he voted Kass out, taking Tony with him to the Final Two.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Woo emphasized his adherence to the five tenets of Tae Kwon Do—discipline, integrity, loyalty, respect, and harmony between mind and body—in spite of the deceitful nature of the game. However, Woo's loyalty and obedience also made the jury question Woo's desire to win. Kass lambasted Woo for his decision to take Tony to the end instead of her, while Spencer compared Woo to a dog loyal to its master. In the end, Tony got 8 jury votes to Woo's sole vote from Tasha, leaving Woo as the runner-up.\n\nAt the Reunion Show, Jeff Probst polled the jury on who would have voted for Woo had he taken Kass with him to the end, with 8 of 9 (including Tony) raising their hands.	11	0	2	7	6	2.57	39	0.28

16	Kass McQuillen	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kass_McQuillen	2	Kass was originally placed on Luzon, the Brains tribe, where she immediately formed a bond with David Samson. After the tribe lost the inaugural Immunity Challenge, Kass and David planned on voting out J'Tia Taylor, but Garrett Adelstein hatched a plan to vote out David for targeting him at the First Impressions twist. At Tribal Council, the tribe blindsided David, leaving Kass on the outs.\n\nThe following morning, Garrett and Spencer Bledsoe approached Kass about making an alliance in order to ensure a majority should the tribe go to Tribal Council again. Kass agreed, but did not see it as a binding agreement. After Luzon lost the next Immunity Challenge, Garrett conducted an open forum for the tribe to agree to vote J'Tia out for costing them the challenge. Tasha Fox did not approve of this and pushed to have private conversations. She later approached Kass in private and lobbied for her to vote with the women. At Tribal Council, Garrett claimed that it was Kass who had approached him and Spencer for an alliance in order to replace J'Tia and Tasha. This prompted Kass to vote against Garrett, blindsiding him and unknowingly flushing his Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nThough Luzon had a brief period of respite after winning immunity on Day 8, they found themselves at Tribal Council yet again after losing the Immunity Challenge on Day 11. The vote came down to Spencer, who was needed for challenge strength, and J'Tia, whom Kass and Tasha considered to be more loyal. The two decided to keep Spencer for future challenges, voting J'Tia out.\n\nThe next day, a Tribe Switch occurred, sending the three remaining members of Luzon to the new Aparri tribe. They found themselves in a position of power due to fractures amongst the old Solana members. At Aparri's only Tribal Council, Kass joined the rest of the tribe in voting out Alexis Maxwell.\n\nOn Day 18, The two tribes then merged into the new Solarrion tribe, with the post-switch Aparri members holding a 6-5 majority over the post-switch Solana members. However, Kass began to conflict with Sarah Lacina, who was torn between voting with her original Brawn tribemates (all of whom were on the opposing Solana Alliance) and the new Aparri Alliance. Kass, feeling shunned by the Aparri Alliance, was approached by Trish Hegarty, who offered to vote out Sarah if Kass joined the Solana Alliance. At Tribal Council, the Aparri Alliance targeted Jefra Bland. Kass, however, decided to join the Solana Alliance in voting out Sarah, making her the first member of the jury, promoting Spencer to angrily remark "Kass, zero chance of winning this game".\n\nNow allied with the Solana Alliance, Kass aided in the eliminations of her former allies. However, she was deliberately excluded in Tony Vlachos' plan to blindside LJ McKanas, along with Jefra and Trish. Despite this, Kass decided to remain allied with him and continued to vote against the Aparri Alliance. But when Tony again turned on the Solana Alliance and blindsided Jefra on Day 30, Kass grew irritated with Tony's constant double-dealing. She got into a confrontation with him the following morning, forcing Tony to reveal that he had found the Hidden Immunity Idol with "special powers", prompting Kass to plot against him.\n\nAfter winning the following Reward Challenge, Kass and Spencer proposed to Woo Hwang to vote with them and Tasha in splitting the vote against Tony and Trish. Though Woo had agreed to the plan, Kass later changed her mind, believing Tony to be the perfect opponent at the Final Tribal Council due to his mismanagement of the jury. Because of this, Kass and Woo proceeded to rejoin Tony and Trish in voting out Tasha.\n\nThe next day, Woo confessed to Tony that he had considered aligning with Spencer and Tasha the previous night, noting that Kass was also in on the plan. Tony later confronted Kass, though he claimed to forgive her and noted that he planned on going to the end with her and Trish. Kass, unsatisfied by this, revealed this to Woo, causing him to doubt his own alliance with Tony. This angered Tony, and led Kass to conspire once again to break up the pair of Tony and Trish. In the midst of her plotting, Kass mentioned that she believed that Trish was a "goat," angering her and leading to a heated confrontation between the two women. At Tribal Council, Kass was spared due to Woo flipping and pulling Tony in with him, causing Trish to become the next member of the jury. After Trish's torch was snuffed and she walked away, Kass gave her the middle finger, shocking the jury.\n\nThe next day, the final four were surprised by a visit from their loved ones, including Kass's husband. At the Immunity Challenge, Kass initially fell behind but managed to stage a comeback, winning herself immunity and sealing Spencer's fate that night. Upon returning to camp, Kass and Woo realized that there would be a Final Two and agreed that voting Tony out was both in their best interests and agreed to take each other to the end. At the Final Immunity Challenge, Woo narrowly beat Kass by half a second to win immunity. Back at camp, both Kass and Tony pleaded with Woo, with Kass stressing her being less than popular with the jury after her move at the merge. At Tribal Council, Woo shocked everyone by voting Kass out, making her the ninth and final member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Kass questioned Woo for his decision to take Tony instead of her, stating that it would have been the better move to make. Kass cast her vote for Tony, whom she felt was more deserving to win the title of Sole Survivor.	4	0	3	4	8	4.43	38	0.11
13	Tasha Fox	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tasha_Fox	2	Because of her intelligence, Tasha Fox was placed on the Luzon tribe. During the First Impressions twist, the tribe elected David Samson as the leader. When he had to pick the weakest member of the tribe, David opted to vote out the muscular Garrett Adelstein due to threat status. J'Tia Taylor took it upon herself to direct the shelter building process, though she didn't actually help with building the shelter, which was considered a miserable failure. At the first Immunity Challenge, Luzon fell behind early and was unable to catch up. After the challenge, Garrett wanted revenge on David for deeming him the weakest. He gathered Tasha, J'Tia, and Spencer Bledsoe to blindside David and succeeded. After the vote, Kass McQuillen decided to be a swing vote for the men or women. At the second challenge of the season, Garrett carried the tribe but J'Tia screwed up the puzzle, costing Luzon the immunity win. Garrett decided to hold an open forum about who to vote out. Tasha was annoyed with this and wanted Garrett out for not playing the game. The decision was complicated when J'Tia dumped the rice into the fire. After a hectic Tribal Council, Kass voted with the women and blindsided Garrett.\n\nTasha was angered by the fact that J'Tia dumped the rice into the fire. After getting the next Tree Mail for the challenge, the tribe decided to practice for the challenge. Despite lagging behind at the challenge, Kass and Spencer were able to place second at the challenge and won Luzon a tarp. The tribe would practice for the next Reward Challenge as well. Tasha was the caller, though because of J'Tia at the last minute, Luzon lost the challenge again. Tasha helped J'Tia practice for the Immunity Challenge by teaching her diving. This did not help and J'Tia struggled yet again. Despite Spencer's efforts and the Aparri tribe trying to throw the challenge, Luzon lost yet again. Tasha was initially going to vote out J'Tia for weakness, but thought about how loyal she was in comparison to Spencer. In the ended, strength outweighed loyalty and J'Tia was unanimously voted out.\n\nThe next Tree Mail implied a food reward, with a challenge involving "Kicking and Screaming". Tasha was delighted to compete for food. At the challenge, a tribe switch commenced. In a random draw of buffs, all members of the Luzon tribe ended up on the new Aparri tribe with Sarah Lacina, Alexis Maxwell, Jeremiah Wood, and Morgan McLeod. Tasha was on the pole for the first round of the challenge and won. However the new Solana tribe won the challenge. Sarah acted as the hostess and revealed that Trish Hegarty picked the extra bag of rice. This made it clear to the former members of the brains tribe that Garrett sought the Hidden Immunity Idol and to the members of the former Solana tribe that Morgan had lied about picking rice over the idol clue. All members of the former Solana tribe were quick to turn on each other and went to the Brains to make alliances. At the Immunity Challenge, Aparri won, despite a slow start.\n\nAt the next Reward Challenge, everyone was shocked that Solana lost two members: Cliff Robinson, who was blindsided, and Lindsey Ogle who quit soon after Tribal Council. Tasha faced off against Trish in the Reward Challenge but barely lost. Solana won the challenge and the right to raid Aparri's camp. Tony Vlachos and Woo Hwang later visited the camp and took the comfort and fishing items. Tony also gave Jeremiah a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol. Jeremiah quickly discovered that the clue was for Solana's camp and thus worthless. Tasha sat out of the Immunity Challenge, which Aparri lost. In a careful decision, Alexis was unanimously voted because she was deemed more likely to flip than Jeremiah.\n\nThe next day, the Solana tribe arrived at the Aparri beach and the tribes merged. The newly merged tribe deemed themselves Solarrion. Sarah was approached by her former tribemates to join them. Sarah flaunted her status as swing vote, annoying Kass in the process. At the Immunity Challenge, Woo defeated Tony for immunity. Sarah adamantly wanted Tony out, but the Aparri Alliance preferred a less obvious person like Jefra Bland to avoid the idol. At Tribal Council, Tony revealed he had an idol. Despite avoiding both idols played by Tony and LJ McKanas, Kass flipped and Sarah was blindsided. For the Reward Challenge, Tasha was placed with Tony, Woo, Trish, and Kass, and subsequently lost the challenge. Woo managed to steal a clue to a Hidden Immunity Idol from Spencer. Despite everyone searching for the super idol, Spencer found it but it was an ordinary idol. Tasha came closing to winning immunity but lost to Spencer. Tony rallied the vote against Morgan because of laziness.\n\nAt this point, Tony wanted LJ out for being the biggest threat. For the next Reward Challenge, Tasha was teamed with Woo and Kass, who lost to Jeremiah, Spencer, and Tony. Tasha attempted to talk to LJ in order to get him and Jefra to flip, but he wanted to avoid making Tony more paranoid. Tasha won immunity over LJ and Tony. Tasha was happy to be safe because of the likelihood of going to the jury. At Tribal Council, the Aparri three joined in Tony's crusade against LJ and blindsided him. At the next reward, Tasha's alliance along with Jefra won the challenge for a feast at a local cave. Upset about LJ's blindside, Jefra agreed to flip. Tasha won immunity again. However, Jefra backed out of flipping and apologized for backing out. At Tribal Council, Tasha announced that she would vote for Tony should he make it to Final Tribal Council. Spencer played his idol but miscalculated on who to use it on, causing Jeremiah's elimination.\n\nOn the outs, Tasha decided to make an women's alliance or at least feign an alliance in front of Tony. At the same time, Spencer was praying on Tony's paranoia to turn on Jefra. The next Tree Mail more or less confirmed a Survivor Auction. Tasha, along with Tony and Spencer waited until an advantage was offered. But when the advantage was offered, Tasha passed it up for a clue for the Hidden Immunity Idol. This was a mistake as the advantage turned out to be a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol and was the last item up for grabs, leaving Tasha upset. However, the advantage did not stop Tasha from winning her third individual Immunity Challenge in a row. Both Tasha and Spencer's efforts worked and Jefra was blindsided in a 4-3 vote. After Tribal Council, Kass was highly upset by Tony's decision and argued with Tony the next day. Tasha's team of Tony, Trish, and herself lost the Reward Challenge. When the others returned, Woo wanted to make a move and vote out Tony. At the Immunity Challenge, Tasha barely lost out immunity to Spencer. The four decided to split the vote between Tony and Trish because of the former's idol. However, Kass talked Woo out of the plan and Tasha was voted out in a 4-1-1 vote.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Tasha was the only person to cast a vote for Woo, who ultimately lost to Tony in a 8-1	6	0	6	7	8	2.33	33	0.18
15	Spencer Bledsoe	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Bledsoe	2	Spencer started out on the Luzon (dubbed the "Brains") tribe. After the tribe lost the inaugural Immunity Challenge, Spencer joined the majority of the tribe in voting David Samson out. Following that Tribal Council, Spencer joined an alliance with Garrett Adelstein and Kass McQuillen to vote out the weakest of the tribe, J'Tia Taylor. However, after Luzon's second straight loss, Kass sided with the women, blindsiding Garrett, and leaving Spencer on the outs. When Luzon lost immunity again on Day 11, Spencer was immediately targeted by the women's alliance. However, Spencer pleaded with Kass and Tasha Fox to keep him in favor of J'Tia, who had cost them victory in almost every challenge. Despite some hesitance to do so, both women decided to keep Spencer for his strength and voted out J'Tia.\n\nOn Day 12, a tribe switch occurred, sending Spencer (along with Tasha and Kass) to the new Aparri tribe. Here, Spencer found himself in a powerful position due to the distrust between the original Solana members. At Aparri's only Tribal Council, Spencer voted out Alexis Maxwell and later made the merge on Day 18. Although the new Aparri Alliance entered the merge with six members as opposed to Solana's five, Spencer was concerned over Sarah Lacina's loyalty due to her previous affiliation with Tony Vlachos. However, Sarah stayed loyal to Spencer's alliance and joined him in voting against Jefra Bland. Unfortunately, Kass decided to join the new Solana Alliance and voted out Sarah, leaving Spencer in the minority once again.\n\nAs his allies continued to be voted out, Spencer was frequently targeted by the Solana Alliance, but he won three individual Immunity Challenges as well as finding a Hidden Immunity Idol (which he used, but ultimately wasted on Day 28). Additionally, Spencer played on Tony's paranoia, frequently pitting him against his own alliance and resulting in the eliminations of LJ McKanas, Jefra, and Trish Hegarty, allowing him to reach the Final Four. After finally losing immunity to Kass on Day 37, Spencer realized that the season would likely end in a Final Two. He told this to Tony and attempted to convince him to vote against Woo Hwang, whom Spencer believed would take Kass to the Final Tribal Council over Tony. He promised Tony that the two would go to the finals together should either of them win the Final Immunity Challenge, if he voted out Woo. In the end though, Tony stuck with Kass and Woo, unanimously voting out Spencer. He became the eighth member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Spencer criticized Woo for following Tony's every move, comparing Woo to a dog following its master, while praising Tony's game-play. In a similar manner to Survivor: Redemption Island castaway David Murphy, Spencer pleaded with the jury to vote for Tony, whom he felt was the more deserving castaway of the million dollars and the title of Sole Survivor. He cast his vote for Tony, who won in an 8-1 vote.	9	1	4	7	8	4.79	37	0.24

15	Keith Nale	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Keith_Nale	2	Keith competed on San Juan del Sur with his son, Wes Nale. On Day Zero, the two lost their "striker" and actually broke the flint. When it was time to separate, Keith got a blue buff and was placed on the Hunahpu tribe. Also, when everyone was gathered, Keith believed that he saw John Rocker, who was infamous for his remarks on minorities and gay people. Jeremy Collins won the Hero Duel and chose Keith to join his wife, Val Collins on Exile Island to take care of her. When the pair arrived at Exile Island, there were two urns. Each of them picked one, with Keith's having a blank piece of paper, while Val's had a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol, which she kept to herself. Upon being reunited with their respective tribes on Day 3, Hunahpu won the first Immunity Challenge. Afterwards, Keith befriended Jeremy and the two made an alliance.\n\nHunahpu won the next two challenges. At the third Hero's duel, Keith was the representative for Hunahpu. However, Keith lost to Wes and was exiled again. Wesley picked Josh Canfield to join him on exile. Before they picked urns, Keith asked if Josh would share his clue with him. However, Keith was the one who picked the urn with the clue and he shared it with Josh. Hunahpu won immunity again, keeping Keith safe. Keith went hunting for the idol, but was unable to find it before Reed Kelly walked in on him. Keith believed that Jeremy had the idol and told everyone that Jeremy already found it. This angered Jeremy, who thought Keith was throwing him under the bus. As it turned out, Jeremy did not have the idol as Keith found it. Hunahpu lost its first immunity, largely because of Drew Christy throwing the challenge in order to vote out one of the women. In the chaos before Tribal Council, the men were divided while the women were annoyed with Drew. Drew was voted out in a 5-2-1-1 vote by the women and Jeremy. Keith received a vote from Jon Misch.\n\nOn Day 11, the tribes arrived the Hero's arena, expecting a duel. Instead, there was a Tribe Switch and everyone drew a random buff. Keith's buff was orange, placing him on the new Coyopa tribe. Keith was upset that not only was he opposite of Wes again, he was also the only person without a loved one on his tribe. However, Keith did not became an immediate target as Dale Wentworth clashed with Missy Payne about her liberally cooking larger servings of Coyopa's carefully rationed rice. Coyopa was destroyed at the Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council, Keith joined the majority of the tribe in the split vote, with Dale's daughter, Kelley Wentworth being voted out in a 3-2-2. Coyopa was unable to win the next Immunity Challenge and headed to Tribal Council again, where he was brought into the plan to vote Dale out. However, Keith was shocked that he had received two votes and was nearly voted out.\n\nAfter Tribal Council, Missy and Baylor Wilson explained why Keith received votes. It was part of a split vote because Dale was claiming to have the idol. Keith didn't care and was going to side with Wesley come the merge. The merge happened on Day 16 and there was a feast to celebrate. Keith won the first individual Immunity Challenge over Wes. However, It was rendered pointless as Julie McGee would quit the game on Day 18. At the Reward Challenge, Keith and Wes were teamed with Jeremy, Reed, and Natalie Anderson and won a trip to a Survivor Taco bar. Before the Immunity Challenge, Keith was worried about Jon's girlfriend, Jaclyn Schultz spending so much time with Baylor, but Alec Christy told Keith not to worry. The initial target, Jeremy beat out Josh to win individual immunity. Josh deemed Baylor the next target and Keith voted against her. However, Josh was voted out in a 6-5 vote because Jaclyn convinced Jon to flip.\n\nAfter Josh's elimination, Keith was annoyed with Jon and Jaclyn for flipping and was aware of being in the minority. Keith gave thought of asking to be voting out and playing his idol. The next Reward Challenge was a series of one on one matches. Keith only went up one against Alec and won. However, Keith's team would lose the challenge. At the Immunity Challenge, Keith did well but fell behind. Baylor would win immunity over Keith. In an attempt to save themselves, Keith, Wes, and Alec all voted against Reed. However, it was Jeremy who would leave the game that night due to a falling out with Jon. \n\nKeith was surprised by Jeremy's elimination but was still happy that he was still in the game. At the next Reward Challenge, Keith was left unpicked and was ineligible for the reward. Back at camp, Reed revealed his new plan to Keith. It was to invoke a Split Vote between Keith and Wes and the former men's alliance vote out Jon. At the Immunity Challenge, Keith grew annoyed with Wesley dropping out of the challenge for chicken wings and beer. Keith himself would lose immunity to Reed. At Tribal Council, Keith said to stick to the plan in response to all of the idol paranoia, which worried Jon. Because of that and Natalie telling him to play his idol, Jon did use his idol, foiling the plan to blindside him. Keith also used his idol at Tribal Council after originally offering it to Wes, who declined. With votes against both men negated, Wes was the one to be eliminated from the game.\n\nAfter Tribal Council, both Alec and Reed pointed out that Keith should not have said "stick to the plan" as it alerted Jon. At the Reward Challenge, Keith was quickly eliminated from the challenge by the majority alliance. They then ended the challenge and let Missy win the reward. Jon volunteered to go Exile Island and Missy picked Baylor and Natalie to join her on the reward. With Jaclyn alone, the men were quick to try to get her to flip. However, the young couple (Jaclyn and Jon) started arguing and didn't agree on whether to vote out Reed or Missy. Keith would win immunity and Reed was voted out unanimously.\n\nAt the next Reward Challenge, Keith failed to win. While the eventual winner of the challenge, Natalie didn't send Keith to Exile Island, Keith did had to watch Natalie and the people she picked, Jaclyn and Jon eat and sleep in a king size bed back at camp. Keith was annoyed with Jaclyn and Jon because of their laziness. Natalie recruited Keith, Alec, and Baylor to vote out Jon if he doesn't win immunity. At the Immunity Challenge, it was neck and neck between Keith and Jon but Jon won immunity. In order to save themselves, Alec and Keith voted against each other. However, Keith was spared because of Natalie voting against Alec.\n\nJaclyn, Jon, and Missy were confused on why Keith wasn't voted out and even Keith pointed out himself that he was consistently escaping elimination. At the Reward Challenge, Keith was teamed with Jon and Missy and won. However, Missy hurt her ankle. Despite the injury, Missy was deemed able to continue the game and chose not to leave. Natalie decided to once again to try blindside Jon. After she won immunity, Natalie decided have a split vote in case Jon used his idol. Keith was happy that "Mister America" or "Miss USA" was leaving instead of him. Natalie plan went off without a hitch and the vote was a 2-2-2 tie, with Jon getting voted out in the revote. \n\nKeith won the Reward Challenge on Day 36, giving him an advantage for the next Immunity Challenge. He was also given the right to exile someone, which Keith chose to exile Jaclyn. In private, Keith's advantage was that it allowed him to practice the challenge. Because of the toll of 36 days on his body, Keith initially struggled practicing. However, when the challenge actually came, Keith was able to win in an blowout. Keith voted against Jaclyn, the obvious target. However, Keith along with the others were shocked that Natalie played the idol on Jaclyn, blindsiding Baylor. At the Final Immunity Challenge, it was initially between Keith and Natalie. However, Jaclyn would ultimately be the one to win the challenge. Without immunity, Keith was unanimously voted out for being the biggest threat to win.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Keith first asked Natalie about her feelings about lying to him before his elimination. Natalie said that she felt bad, but if it was not him, that it would have been her voted out and explained that she had to sell him as the biggest threat as the goal was to get to Day 39. Keith said he hated the constant lying, but had accepted the fluidity of ethics in-game. Keith ended up voting for Natalie to win the game.	12	1	4	7	6	3.36	38	0.32
9	Jeremy Collins	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jeremy_Collins	3	Jeremy started the game on Day Zero with his wife, Val Collins. The next day they were split: Jeremy was designated to Hunahpu, and Val was assigned to Coyopa. When Jeff Probst then announced there would be a Hero Duel, Jeremy eagerly volunteered for the opportunity, not knowing his opponent. When Jeff explained he would compete against his wife - the loser going to Exile Island - Jeremy was ready for the challenge. He got out to a fast start in the challenge and never let up, winning soundly and sending Val to Exile; he then chose Keith Nale from his own tribe to join her based on his profession.\n\nHunahpu was dysfunctional for much of the pre-merge but were buoyed by their challenge dominance. He did, however, visit Exile Island with John Rocker during the second episode, as he was chosen by Julie McGee. There, John promised he would do what he could to protect Val back at Coyopa. However, Val bluffed too hard, claiming she had two idols. John's plan to save her revolved around her playing an idol - an idol she didn't have. Val was voted out on a revote at that Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 7, Jeremy saw his wife had been voted out and forced John to confess to his tribe that he had tried to save Val, leading to John's ouster the next day. Hunahpu then visited Tribal Council for the first time on Day 10 after Drew Christy threw the Immunity Challenge. Jeremy voted with the women of his tribe, blindsiding Drew 5-2-1-1.\n\nAfter the tribe switch, Jeremy remained on Hunahpu with his allies Natalie Anderson and Julie, but they were outnumbered by the alliance of Josh Canfield, Reed Kelly, Alec Christy, and Wes Nale. Luckily, they didn't lose any Immunity Challenges after the switch. They did, however, have to trade most of their belongings for a new supply of rice, as they had overeaten and were entirely out of food.\n\nAfter the merge, two factions arose: Jeremy's alliance, including Julie, Natalie, Baylor Wilson, and Missy Payne; and Josh's, including Reed, Alec, Wes, and Keith. This left Jaclyn Schultz and Jon Misch as the swing votes. On Day 18, it seemed as if Josh had successfully roped in Jon and Jaclyn, and they were targeting Jeremy. However, he was spared by the fact that his ally, Julie, quit.\n\nIn the next episode, Jeremy won his only individual Immunity Challenge, narrowly defeating Josh. Some chauvinistic comments and actions by a member of Josh's alliance - namely, Alec - offended Jaclyn, causing her and Jon to flip over to Jeremy's alliance. They successfully voted Josh out on Day 21, 6-5.\n\nThe next day, Jeremy won the Reward Challenge, but along with Natalie opted to give their respective rewards to Jon and Jaclyn as repayment for their votes the night before. Jon returned the favor by sending Jeremy to his second stint on Exile Island. There, he realized that Jon, the previous inhabitant, had found the Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nBaylor won immunity on Day 24, and Reed, sensing he was in trouble, scrambled to shake up the vote. He found Keith's Hidden Immunity Idol clue in his bag and brought it to the attention of some of his tribemates. However, what ultimately changed the tribe dynamic was Jeremy's confronting Jon about his possession of an idol, which Jon denied. Jon then rallied together Jaclyn, Baylor, Missy, and Reed to vote Jeremy out. They did so successfully, eliminating the Foxboro firefighter, 5-3-2, to become the second member of the jury.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Jeremy made a speech advocating for Natalie, praising her as the best player of the season. Jeremy voted for his former ally Natalie to win, which she did, 5-2-1.	12	0	10	8	8	5.11	24	0.50

18	Natalie Anderson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Natalie_Anderson	2	Natalie entered the game with her twin sister Nadiya where they were assigned to different tribes, with Natalie in Hunahpu and Nadiya on Coyopa. Natalie's tribe won the first Immunity Challenge, at the cost of her sister getting voted out on Day 3. Saddened by being away from her sister potentially for the longest time, Natalie found a kindred spirit in Jeremy Collins, whose wife Val was voted out next. Hunahpu eventually went on to win 5 of the first 6 challenges. Still a full tribe of 9 by Day 10, Drew Christy plotted to throw the Immunity Challenge to eliminate one of the women. However, Natalie and the rest of the women turned the tables on Drew, blindsiding him with the help of Jeremy's vote.\n\nA Day 12 Tribe Switch turned Hunahpu into almost a tribe of players whose loved ones were already voted out, with Josh Canfield and Reed Kelly being the only pair in the tribe. Natalie and Jeremy worried their fellow original Hunahpu member Reed could be swayed into joining the other "singles", all of whom were from the original Coyopa. Natalie's winning streak in Hunahpu continued however, but the tribe's squandering of its food supply came to a head when Jeff Probst confiscated all of their reward items in exchange for a bag of rice.\n\nFollowing yet another Hero Duel win for Hunahpu, Natalie volunteered to join Baylor Wilson on Exile Island where they shared a clue to a Hidden Immunity Idol. Hunahpu won one final time at the Immunity Challenge, allowing Natalie to enter the merge, becoming a member of the new Huyopa tribe.\n\nAt the merge, Natalie and Jeremy formed a coalition of singles against the remaining pairs in the game, with dating couple Jaclyn Schultz and Jon Misch in the middle for having close ties with both. Natalie found initial success by taking out Reed, but was blindsided when Jaclyn and Jon turned on Jeremy. With her closest ally gone, Natalie swore to get her revenge which came into fruition when Natalie convinced Jaclyn and Jon to turn against the remaining couples by blindsiding Wes and tricked them into believing he voted Alec out of confusion. The couples alliance fragmented, with only Keith remaining from the alliance.\n\nSent to Exile Island after the Reward Challenge, Natalie reflected on what has been her longest time being separated from her sister, which inspired her to win the next Immunity Challenge. Back at camp, Jon attempted to solidify trust with Natalie by revealing to her his possession of an idol. However, Natalie, who was only biding her time to avenge Jeremy, convinced the tribe to split the vote between Jon and Jaclyn, forcing a 2-2-2 tie. At the revote, Natalie finally collected her revenge by eliminating Jon out with the idol in his pocket. This led into an argument between Natalie and Jaclyn back at camp, in which Natalie was expecting to convince everyone not to work with Jaclyn.\n\nThe next day, Natalie prepared to dismantle the last remaining pair in the game: mother and daughter tandem Missy Payne and Baylor. Natalie returned to Jaclyn's good graces by playing the idol for her, blindsiding Baylor. Despite Natalie eliminating her daughter from the game, Missy was not upset with her as she did not have to vote out her own daughter. Following her loss at the Final Immunity Challenge to Jaclyn, Natalie became worried that she could be voted out given she had made late-game blindsides which could impress the jury, but was relieved when Jaclyn and Missy joined her to eliminate Keith, leaving the three women as the Final Three.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Natalie's narrative of effectively navigating through the game despite the early eliminations of her sister and her closest ally impressed the jury the most, winning her the title of Sole Survivor in a 5-2-1 vote.	13	1	1	8	9	3.29	39	0.33

5	Kelley Wentworth	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kelley_Wentworth	3	Kelley entered the game with her father Dale Wentworth, and was placed on the Hunahpu tribe. Due to Hunahpu winning most of the Immunity Challenges, Kelley remained safe for the first nine days. However, on Day 10, Drew Christy threw the Immunity Challenge for Hunahpu with the goal of voting Kelley out, considering her a threat. At camp, Drew openly plotted against Kelley, even campaigning to vote her out while she stood a few feet away. Shocked by this, Kelley joined with the rest of the women and Jeremy Collins to vote Drew out, blindsiding him in a 5-2-1-1 vote.\n\nThe next day, a tribe switch occurred, sending Kelley to Coyopa where she was reunited with her father, Dale. Conflicts quickly emerged between Dale and Missy Payne over her liberal cooking of the tribe's carefully conserved rice supply, forcing Kelley to play "peacemaker" to try and prevent Dale from being voted out. When Coyopa lost the following Immunity Challenge, Kelley and her father attempted to persuade Jaclyn Schultz and Jon Misch to align with them and vote out Missy's daughter, Baylor Wilson. Unfortunately for her, Jaclyn and Jon sided with Missy and Baylor, helping them split the vote between Kelley and Dale. In the end, Kelley was voted out by a vote of 3-2-2.	6	0	14	7	6	1.2	13	0.46

8	Alicia Calaway	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Alicia_Calaway	2	Alicia was initially placed on the Kucha tribe, where she proved to be an asset because of her physical fitness, thus she was not targeted early on in the game. After Kucha lost the first Immunity Challenge, she was approached by both Debb Eaton and Jeff Varner, who were trying to get each other voted out. Alicia was more receptive to Jeff and participated in the unanimous elimination of Debb at the first Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 4, Alicia and her tribemates became annoyed that Michael Skupin put rice on the fire without asking, thinking that he did it just because he was hungry. Alicia believed there to be an overall theme to Michael thinking things revolved around him, including when he started to catch fish for the tribe and his use of their only knife to hunt for pigs. Kucha won a Reward Challenge on Day 11, winning three egg-laying chickens and a rooster. Days later, Alicia got into a heated argument with Kimmi Kappenberg, because of the latter's vegetarianism, as Kimmi wanted to regulate the consumption of the chickens, leading to Alicia to exclaim to Kimmi, "I will always wave my finger in your face." When Kucha again lost immunity on Day 15, Alicia joined her tribe in voting out Kimmi. However, Kucha suffered a setback a few days later when Michael was medically evacuated from the game after he passed out and fell into the fire.\n\nWith Michael's evacuation, the tribes merged into the Barramundi tribe even in numbers on Day 20. At the tribe's first Tribal Council, the vote was tied between the Kucha Alliance's Jeff and Colby Donaldson from the opposing Ogakor Alliance. When the revote yielded a deadlock, the tiebreaker rules necessitated past votes being taken into account; Colby had none, while Jeff had two (from Debb and Kimmi), sending Jeff home and leaving the Kucha Alliance in the minority. After Keith Famie won the next Immunity Challenge, the Ogakor Alliance set their sights on Alicia, whom they saw as the Kucha Alliance's strongest member, voting her out 5-4, making her the first member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Alicia asked the Final Two what their proudest and least proud moments of the game were. She gave her jury vote to Tina Wesson, saying that she played the game by using her head. Tina would win in a 4-3 vote over Colby.	6	0	9	6	5	2.88	24	0.25
11	Amber Brkich	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Amber_Brkich	3	Amber was a participant in the second season of Survivor, having auditioned for the season to put off getting a job after college. She was a member of the green Ogakor tribe. She was quick to fortify a strong friendship with fellow contestant Jerri Manthey, who helped construct a majority alliance with Colby Donaldson and Mitchell Olson. Ogakor seemed to be the weaker of the two tribes, losing three consecutive Immunity Challenges following their initial victory. Before Ogakor's first Tribal Council, Amber's ally, Jerri, accused fellow tribemate Kel Gleason of smuggling beef jerky into the game. Amber helped the tribe search Kel's bag when he was away, but they failed to find anything. Amber voted for Kel at Tribal Council because she considered him to be the least trustworthy member of the tribe.\n\nAfter losing the next challenge, Amber targeted Maralyn Hershey because of her weakness at the Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council Maralyn was voted off. At Ogakor's next Tribal Council Amber thought her four-person alliance was going to eliminate the tribal annoyance Keith Famie. She was surprised to learn that her ally Colby had flipped on her alliance, thus causing a tiebreaker between Mitchell and Keith. Amber's ally, Mitchell was eliminated by the tiebreaker. Ogakor went on to win all the following Immunity Challenge's, keeping Amber safe until the merge.\n\nUpon the merge, Ogakor managed to use the knowledge that one of Kucha's members, Jeff Varner, had received votes beforehand, and eliminated him through a tiebreaker, thus gaining a numeric advantage over the Kucha tribe. The ex-Ogakor members stuck together in eliminating Alicia Calaway, but the ex-Kucha tribe then convinced Keith, Colby, and Tina Wesson to turn on their alliance and vote out Amber's closest ally, Jerri. After Jerri's elimination, the Ogakor Alliance once again came together to oust Nick Brown. In No Longer Just a Game Amber felt secure in her alliance and thought they were going to vote out Rodger Bingham. Unfortunately for Amber the remaining Kucha members once again convinced Tina and Keith to turn on their alliance. At Tribal Council, Amber was voted out for playing an "under-the-radar game", and was a threat to win the show, ultimately landing in sixth place. Colby was the only one to not vote against her, hoping Ogakor would "stick to the batting order".\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, as a member of the jury, Amber cast her vote for Colby, who ended up losing to Tina Wesson in a close 4-3 vote.	4	0	6	7	6	2.09	33	0.12
6	Michael Skupin	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Skupin	2	Michael proved useful to the Kucha, being able to carry heavy loads to their camp during the opening trek. He tried to take control of the building of their shelter on Day 1, despite Rodger Bingham having more experience in the field of construction, though it did not seem to annoy anyone except for Debb Eaton, who voiced her resentment of him doing so. After losing the first Immunity Challenge, Michael participated in the unanimous ousting of Debb.\n\nOn Day 4, Michael woke up early and put rice on the fire. This upset some of his tribe because they were not hungry and considered it a waste of their limited food supply. Michael claimed he was trying to make food for the tribe before they woke up, but some tribemates thought he made the rice just for himself. The rice turned out bad, but Michael was shocked that they not only did not appreciate it, but they did not like it. He claimed that his tribe was getting edgy without food and that they were not aware of how bad it was going to get. He decided to go fishing to at least provide his tribe a full meal. Another reason for his fishing was because during Kucha's first Tribal Council, he claimed he was made the tribe leader, a position he wished to avoid, although some of the other castaways privately said they thought Michael made himself the leader. By catching fish, he hoped to shy away from the leadership position and to focus on that one activity. However, by doing this, he only further put himself in a bad position, though, by referring to himself as the leader and focusing on his accomplishments.\n\nOn Day 6, still on his quest to provide food for the tribe, Michael set out in hunt of a wild pig, generating controversy among fans. He crafted a spear with a stick and a knife, which only worried his tribe because it was their only knife and they did not want to lose it.\n\nAfter Kucha won chickens in the fourth Reward Challenge, Michael felt threatened he might become useless as a food provider now, and decided to kill and eat the chickens as soon as possible, which openly disturbed vegetarian tribemate Kimmi Kappenberg.\n\nOn Day 17, while tending the campfire, Michael inhaled some smoke and passed out, accidentally falling into the fire and burning his hands. He immediately jumped into the cold Herbert River waters to ease the pain and tribe mates Alicia Calaway and Elisabeth Filarski got into the water to comfort him until medical arrived. The Survivor medical team arrived and immediately airlifted him out of the game. Before leaving, the five remaining Kucha members vowed to win to his honor.	6	0	11	4	3	3.5	17	0.35
9	Jerri Manthey	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jerri_Manthey	3	Jerri quickly made enemies within her Ogakor tribe, notably Keith Famie over his questionable cooking. Ogakor won the first Immunity Challenge on Day 3, thus sparing Jerri.\n\nIn an infamous Survivor moment, Jerri accused Kel Gleason of eating beef jerky without the consent of the tribe, angering his starving tribemates. Jerri, Amber Brkich, and Tina Wesson looked through his bag to see if there was any beef jerky, but there was none. Kel overheard the conversation and confronted the tribe, most of whom believed he had been eating beef jerky. Maralyn Hershey, who believed Kel did not have any beef jerky, told Jerri to apologize to Kel, but Jerri refused.\n\nAfter Ogakor lost the second Immunity Challenge, Jerri came up as a target because of her rough personality and her general unpleasantness. She herself was seeking to vote out Kel because she considered him a liar and a cheater. Her arguments won over her tribemates, and the tribe eliminated Kel unanimously.\n\nJerri later confessed that she was attracted to tribemate Colby Donaldson, and tried ways to lure him to potentially make an alliance. Much to her chagrin, Colby seemed unaffected.\n\nAfter the tribes merged into the Barramundi tribe, she and the rest of the remaining Ogakors stayed strong during the first two Tribal Councils, eliminating two of their former Kucha opponents. But Colby, Keith, and Tina felt that they could now afford to lose one of their own since they would still have the majority, and with the help of the three remaining Kucha members, Jerri was their first victim.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Jerri cast her jury vote for eventual winner Tina.	6	0	8	4	6	6.67	27	0.22
7	Jeff Varner	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jeff_Varner	3	Jeff Varner became a notable player in "Survivor: The Australian Outback" (Season 2), which aired in 2001. As a member of the Kucha tribe, Varner quickly established himself as a strategic player, keen on forming alliances and navigating the early politics of the game. His gameplay was characterized by his willingness to strategize and form early bonds, particularly with fellow tribe members Alicia Calaway, Kimmi Kappenberg, and Michael Skupin. Varner's strategic approach aimed to secure a stable position within his tribe, leveraging these relationships to advance in the game.\n\nHowever, Varner's game took a dramatic turn after the merge. The Kucha and Ogakor tribes entered the merge evenly split with five members each. The balance of power was disrupted when Michael Skupin was medically evacuated, leaving Kucha at a numerical disadvantage. This shift significantly impacted Varner's position in the game. Despite his efforts to navigate the post-merge dynamics and form new alliances, Varner became a target for the former Ogakor members. His strategic gameplay and perceived threat level made him a focus, and he was eventually voted out, finishing in 10th place.\n\nVarner's gameplay in "Survivor: The Australian Outback" was marked by his strategic thinking and social gameplay, but his journey was cut short by unforeseen circumstances and the complex dynamics of a merged tribe. His early exit did not diminish the impact of his gameplay, making him a memorable player from the season.	6	0	10	7	8	5	21	0.29
16	Tina Wesson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tina_Wesson	3	As part of the Ogakor tribe, Tina was not targeted in the beginning of the game, seeming to mesh well with all her tribemates and was not seen as a physical liability, despite losing the Day 6 Immunity Challenge for Ogakor.\n\nWhen Ogakor lost immunity on Day 15, Tina proved to be a strategic player when she managed to convince allies Colby Donaldson and Keith Famie to force a tie between Keith and Mitchell Olson (who was aligned with Amber Brkich and Jerri Manthey), whereby Mitchell would be voted out due to his previous vote at the Day 12 Tribal Council. Tina's plan worked, eliminating Mitchell and allowing her, Colby, and Keith to wrestle control of the Ogakor Alliance from Amber and Jerri.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Barramundi tribe on Day 20, the tribe was evenly divided between the original members of Ogakor and Kucha. Facing a tie at the first Tribal Council as a merged tribe, Tina threw the first individual Immunity Challenge to Keith, thereby preventing the Kucha Alliance from being able to vote against him, preventing the possibility of Keith being eliminated due to previous votes if the vote resulted in a deadlock. The Ogakor Alliance then voted for Kucha's Jeff Varner; the vote indeed resulted in a deadlock and Jeff was eliminated by virtue of his previous votes, effectively handing control of the tribe to the Ogakor Alliance. Tina's subsequent strategic prowess then allowed the Ogakor Alliance success over the Kucha Alliance by systematically eliminating them, while having a perfect timing to eliminate two of their own, Jerri and Amber, when needed.\n\nAfter Amber's departure, Tina, Colby, and Keith took control and eliminated the remaining two Kuchas, Rodger Bingham and then Elisabeth Filarski, at the next two Tribal Councils. After Colby won the Final Immunity Challenge, he chose to eliminate the unpopular Keith instead of Tina, a move that would ultimately cost him the win.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Tina became the Sole Survivor in a narrow 4-3 vote, in which she gained the votes of Elisabeth, Jerri, Keith, and Alicia Calaway, making history by becoming the first woman to win the game.	5	0	1	7	9	4.93	42	0.12
15	Colby Donaldson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Colby_Donaldson	3	At the start of the season, Colby quipped that the trip to find their camp, 'fired him up' because it was a good way to see what his tribemates were made of. He took on an early leadership role in the tribe. He then made a plan with Keith to keep the tribe moving along the creek bed; Keith scouted ahead to see how much farther the camp was.\n\nHe was a physical asset to his tribe. He helped them win the first Immunity Challenge. However, the second Immunity Challenge was not strength-based and Ogakor lost. Colby, with the other Ogakors in a unanimous vote, ousted Kel Gleason.\n\nInitially, Colby and Jerri seemed to have some chemistry, although there was suspicion that Jerri had ulterior motives. After Maralyn's poor performance at the third Immunity Challenge, Colby voted with the rest of his tribe and eliminated her. After losing their third consecutive Immunity Challenge, Jerri boldly alienated Tina and Keith by stating that Colby, Amber, and Mitchell were her friends. This gesture caused Tina to ask Colby his opinion of Jerri, slowly broaching the subject of voting with them. Colby did not want to vote for Keith, who was the main target next Tribal Council. He bonded with Keith and saw him as a valuable ally to have later on in the game and so that night Colby voted with Tina and Keith to force a tie in Ogakor. Since Mitchell had received a previous vote in the last Tribal Council, he was eliminated. After Ogakor's three-time Immunity winning streak, all five remaining Ogakors remained intact until the merge. Colby became one of ten castaways to comprise the merged Barramundi tribe.\n\nDue to Ogakor's plan to make Kucha believe he had received past votes cast against him, the rival Kucha tribe cast their five votes for him at the merge. Colby got the back of his Ogakor comrades and all of them voted for Kucha member Jeff Varner. After a deadlocked tie, previous votes were taken into account. While Colby had no previous votes, Varner already had two (from Debb Eaton and Kimmi Kappenberg), which caused Varner's ouster. Donaldson would later become a force to be reckoned with, winning eight of the final ten challenges, while his core alliance of Tina and Keith had voted the competition off, thus leaving the threesome as the final three castaways. Colby's winning streak not only spared him from elimination but also made a critical decision of taking either Tina or Keith to the Final Tribal Council. Although he thought Keith would be easier to beat, he felt that Tina was more deserving, sending Keith to the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Colby's decision to bring Tina was considered by fans a big mistake, and which was widely believed to have cost him the competition, because four of the seven jury members gave their votes to Tina, making her the second Sole Survivor and leaving Colby as the runner-up.	12	0	2	7	8	7	42	0.29
5	Kimmi Kappenberg	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kimmi_Kappenberg	2	Kimmi was placed on the Kucha tribe where she proved to be a very lively contestant by expressing what came to mind. On their first night in the game, she entertained her fellow Kucha tribemates at camp, talking about 'risque' subjects that upset Debb Eaton. Jeff Varner also was annoyed by her loud talking their first night because he was still feeling sick from their hike to the camp. After Kucha lost the first Immunity Challenge, the friction between Kimmi and Debb was a factor in Kimmi taking part in the unanimous elimination of Debb at Tribal Council, though she cried after the votes were read.\n\nFor the second Immunity Challenge, the castaways had to eat a variety of disgusting dishes. Kimmi, being a vegetarian, was not willing to sacrifice her morals by eating any animal. During the challenge, she had to eat a cow brain, but refused. A tiebreaker came down between Kimmi and Ogakor's Tina Wesson, where they had to eat a mangrove worm, much to Kimmi's delight, since she could chow down the specimen. Kimmi was able to eat the dish faster than Tina, winning Kucha immunity.\n\nKimmi took over the role of water provider, going on many trips to replenish and boil her tribe's water supply. After her tribe won chickens in the fourth Reward Challenge, Kimmi once again found herself grappling with her vegetarian beliefs as she could not stand to see the way her tribemates handled the chickens, leading to one of Survivor's most iconic conflicts, the infamous finger-wagging debacle between Kimmi and tribemate Alicia Calaway. When Kucha finally broke their record of four consecutive challenge wins by losing the fifth Immunity Challenge, her liberated and grating demeanor caused her tribemates to eliminate her in a unanimous 6-1 vote.	5	0	12	8	7	3.2	15	0.33

11	Shirin Oskooi	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Shirin_Oskooi	2	Shirin was originally placed on the White Collar tribe where she was perceived as irritating by some of her fellow tribemates, such as Joaquin Souberbielle and Tyler Fredrickson, for being enthusiastic and talkative. In the first Immunity Challenge, she found herself in the hot seat after the White Collar tribe lost, largely due to Shirin's poor performance on the puzzle portion of the challenge. She was spared by her tribemates on account of her bravery to step up during the challenge, and they instead voted out So Kim for her antics.\n\nAfter the tribe switch, Shirin was put on Nagarote, where she was again criticized by tribe members Jenn Brown and Will Sims II for being annoying. In their first challenge as new tribes, Nagarote suffered an embarrassing defeat. Shirin was on the chopping block for her behavior, but they instead blindsided her ally, Max Dawson, for similar reasons.\n\nShirin made the merge and the line was beginning to be drawn between the Blue Collars and the No Collars, leaving Shirin in the middle along with her former White Collar tribe members, Tyler and Carolyn. When it came time for the first vote, Shirin joined the No Collars in blindsiding Kelly Remington when Jenn used her idol. However, Carolyn and Tyler sided with the Escameca Alliance and left Shirin's alliance in the minority. Her alliance members were picked off one by one, first Hali Ford, then Joe Anglim. After the Survivor Auction, Will was angry at Shirin for distrusting his honesty in sharing his reward. Will proceeded to yell at her saying that no one misses her at home while she is gone. Despite some people who witnessed it at the camp were stunned by Will's comments, they didn't comfort or defend her. Shirin felt personally attacked for she had grown up in a family that was a victim of domestic abuse. Her newfound ally Mike Holloway broke up the conflict and comforted Shirin at this low point of the game. With their target set on Mike, the majority alliance was disappointed when Mike won immunity, thus they instead voted out Shirin's ally, Jenn. The next Immunity Challenge with the last man and last woman standing would win Immunity. Shirin lost out to Carolyn while Mike won immunity for the men in the next episode, leaving Shirin as the next one to go. At Tribal Council, Mike attempted to save Shirin by revealing his Hidden Immunity Idol, attempting to convince the other castaways to think he would use it on her. Unfortunately for Shirin, some of them called Mike's bluff and voted Shirin out in a 4-2-2 vote with some of them clapping after she was ousted.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Shirin gave a speech reminiscent of Sue Hawk's "Snakes and Rats" by comparing Mike to a howler monkey due to his prowess in challenges and his gameplay. She compared Carolyn to a stingray because of her under-the-radar gameplay until making a big move when the time was right. Then, she was merciless in her analogy of Will and retaliated by comparing him to a dead fish for his vile and toxic attitude towards her. She ultimately gave her vote to Mike, who she saw as her savior during Will's tirade, who ultimately won 6-1-1.	7	0	8	4	6	3	29	0.24

14	Sierra Dawn Thomas	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sierra_Dawn_Thomas	2	Sierra was initially placed on the "Blue Collar" Escameca tribe. In the early days, she and her friend Lindsey Cascaddan were criticized by her tribemates for their lack of work ethic around camp, and quickly found themselves near the bottom of the tribal hierarchy. Escameca won the first three Immunity Challenges, but finally lost immunity on Day 11. Sierra and Lindsey then attempted to target Rodney Lavoie Jr. for his sexist comments about women, as well as his poor performance in the challenge, with Sierra claiming that "my horses are smarter than Rodney". At Tribal Council, the votes were split between her, Lindsey, and Rodney, with Lindsey being eliminated in the revote. Back at camp, Sierra was upset because she was all alone and vowed revenge on her tribe. To make matters worse, Rodney and Dan Foley vocalized their issues with her, which upset Mike Holloway, who was trying to keep the tribe unified.\n\nThe following day, a tribe switch occurred and Sierra found herself with four of the five remaining original Escameca members within a new seven-member Escameca tribe. Due to her rocky relationships with both Dan and Rodney, she contemplated joining a new four-person alliance with the newer members. However, the tribe reverted its target to Joe Anglim instead as Rodney, Joaquin Souberbielle, and Tyler Fredrickson viewed him as too large of a physical threat. Mike and Rodney threw the Day 16 Immunity Challenge in an attempt to get rid of Joe and keep Kelly Remington, the only original Escameca member switched to the Nagarote tribe, safe. Dan and Mike, however, considered keeping Joe in order to split up the close bond forming between Joaquin and Rodney, leaving Sierra as the swing vote. Sierra ultimately rejoined forces with Mike and voted against Joaquin, blindsiding him in a 4-3 vote.\n\nOn Day 17, the tribes merged into the Merica tribe and she joined the Escameca Alliance consisting of original Blue Collars and White Collars. The alliance targeted Joe, but he won immunity so the target was switched to Jenn Brown. At Tribal Council, Jenn played her Hidden Immunity Idol negating the seven votes cast against her and resulting in Kelly being blindsided in a 4-1-0 vote. Joe won immunity again on Day 22, and the alliance targeted Hali Ford. However, Sierra considered joining an all-female alliance with the girls from the Nagarote Alliance to vote out Dan, with whom she still shared a rocky history with. At Tribal Council though, she remained loyal to her Escameca Alliance and Hali was blindsided in a 7-4 vote. Joe would finally lose the next Immunity Challenge and was voted out at the following Tribal Council. After the Survivor Auction on Day 25, Mike blew up Rodney's inner alliance of himself, Tyler, Carolyn Rivera, and Will Sims II to the whole tribe. However, this and Mike's earlier actions at the Survivor Auction made Sierra and the others turn on him. The new plan to take out Mike was put on hold as won immunity on Day 27, the alliance voted out Jenn at Tribal Council.\n\nMike won immunity again on Day 29 and Shirin Oskooi became the target. After the challenge, Shirin told Sierra to get rid of Tyler because he was a challenge threat. Sierra wanted to get rid of Tyler but was not sure if her alliance would do so and at Tribal Council, Shirin was voted out. On Day 30, the team of Sierra, Carolyn, and Mike won reward. However, they did not give it up to Rodney, which infuriated him because it was his birthday. After Carolyn won immunity on Day 32, the majority alliance of six was forced to turn on each other due to Mike having a Hidden Immunity Idol. Carolyn proposed to Sierra, Dan, and Rodney that they split their votes between Mike and Tyler. At Tribal Council, Mike played his idol negating the four votes cast against him; Sierra, Carolyn, and Mike voted for Tyler and he was sent to the jury.\n\nAfter Mike won immunity on Day 35, Dan told Sierra to vote for Carolyn, though she considered voting for Dan because of his Extra Vote advantage. Mike later told Sierra and Carolyn that Dan, Rodney, and Will were voting for Carolyn. At Tribal Council, Sierra joined Dan, Rodney, and Will in voting for Carolyn. Dan used his Extra Vote advantage and cast a second vote for Carolyn. However, Carolyn played her Hidden Immunity Idol, negating the five votes against her and blindsiding Dan in a 2-0 vote. On Day 36, the final five got to meet their loved ones; Sierra met her dad, Danny. Mike won immunity on Day 37, forcing the majority alliance of four to turn on each other. Sierra made a Final Three deal with Carolyn and Mike and target Rodney that night. However, unknown to Sierra that Mike had another plan in operation with Rodney and Will to blindside Sierra, possibly being a bigger jury threat than Rodney. At Tribal Council, she openly stated she was a threat and claimed that the tribe should be voting out unworthy players. Unfortunately for her, Carolyn and Mike did not agree, and Sierra was blindsided in a unanimous vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Sierra asked Will which of the other finalists' traits he wanted. In the end, she was the only juror to vote for Carolyn, who lost to Mike in a 6-1-1 vote.	7	0	5	6	7	1.5	37	0.19

9	Joe Anglim	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Joe_Anglim	3	Joe was placed on the "No Collar" Nagarote tribe, where he immediately fit in, not just because of his physical abilities, but his camp life skills and personality. He and Jenn Brown had an immediate bond, which made Vince Sly insecure about his position in the game. Joe formed a strong alliance with Jenn and Hali Ford, with Will Sims II as their fourth, not knowing that Will was working with Vince and Nina Poersch. Nagarote went to their first Tribal Council on Day 6, with Joe's alliance planning to split the votes between Nina and Vince, then voting out the weaker Nina in the revote. Will wavered between targeting Jenn or Nina until Nina told Will that Vince was concerned with Will's health after a poor challenge performance. Will took this as a threat, so Will went rogue and voted for Vince, which sent him home over the intended target Nina. This shock move caused Joe's alliance to question whether to vote Nina or Will out next. They would have to make a decision sooner than later following a second consecutive Immunity Challenge loss. They split the vote between the two, but took out Nina.\n\nAfter the Tribe Switch on Day 12, Joe was the only member of his original tribe on the new Escameca tribe, which had four original Blue Collars and two original White Collars. Joe initially sided with White Collars Joaquin Souberbielle and Tyler Fredrickson as they hoped to swing Sierra Dawn Thomas on their side. However, Joaquin began getting closer to Rodney Lavoie Jr., and the two of them targeted Joe, forcing Joe to work with Dan Foley and Mike Holloway, the latter of whom was especially concerned that Joaquin and Rodney would become a power couple following the merge. After Escameca lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 16, Joe, Dan, and Mike succeeded in gaining Sierra's trust and Joaquin was voted out in a close 4-3 vote.\n\nDespite working with the Blue Collars following the switch, Joe returned to his Nagarote Alliance, which managed to recruit Shirin Oskooi, post-merge, thus leaving the remaining White Collars Tyler and Carolyn Rivera as the swing votes. Joe was the target of the Escameca Alliance for his physical strength, but that plan was put on hold as Joe won the first two individual Immunity Challenges. Though Joe's alliance was able to deal a blow to the opposing alliance thanks to Jenn's Hidden Immunity Idol play during the first vote to oust Kelly Remington, losing Carolyn, Tyler, and Will to the Escameca Alliance resulted in Hali being voted out during Joe's second round of immunity. At that point, Jenn expressed her desire to leave the game, while Joe, on the other hand, was determined to stay in the game by any means necessary. Joe finally lost immunity to Tyler on Day 24, prompting him to draw on his skills as a jewelry designer to make a fake idol in the hopes that it would save him. He gave it to Mike hoping to establish a level of trust, and Mike considered keeping him over Jenn. However, Mike knew that the idol was fake as he had a real one, and the plan to take out Joe finally came to fruition, making him the second member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Joe would vote for Mike over Carolyn and Will, helping him win the title of Sole Survivor.	8	0	10	8	7	2.89	24	0.33

8	Hali Ford	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Hali_Ford	2	Hali was placed in the "No Collar" Nagarote tribe, where she formed a close bond with Jenn Brown. Despite a victory in the initial Immunity Challenge, the tribe lost on Day 6. Before the vote, Hali and Jenn formed an alliance with Joe Anglim, targeting Nina Poersch due to her constant complaints about her hearing disability. At Tribal Council, the vote split between Jenn and Vince Sly, but a pivotal flip by Will Sims II blindsided Vince in a 3-2-1 vote. Hali's alliance succeeded in eliminating Nina next, overcoming internal dilemmas about voting out Will.\n\nAfter a tribe switch on Day 12, Hali remained with Jenn and Will on Nagarote. Following the switch, Hali grew frustrated with Max Dawson and Shirin Oskooi's constant strategic discussions, leading to Max's elimination at the Day 14 Tribal Council. After Nagarote's Immunity win on Day 17, Hali joined the merged tribe Merica.\n\nPost-merge, Hali and Jenn reconnected with Joe and also recruited Shirin into their alliance. However, Will's defection to the Escameca Alliance left them in an 8-4 deficit. Despite Jenn using a Hidden Immunity Idol to eliminate Kelly Remington on Day 19, Hali and her allies struggled to gain traction. Facing a 7-4 vote on Day 22, Hali became the first jury member after she failed to pull Sierra Dawn Thomas and Tyler Fredrickson to her side.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Hali queried Carolyn Rivera about how being a mother impacted her game. Though Hali seemed satisfied with Carolyn's responses, she ultimately voted for Mike Holloway to be the Sole Survivor, who secured a 6-1-1 victory.	5	0	11	8	7	1.75	22	0.23

20	Jeremy Collins	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jeremy_Collins	3	Jeremy was chosen by public vote from thirty-two candidates to compete on the "Second Chance" season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nJeremy was a part of the Bayon tribe. After hitting the beach, he immediately formed alliances with Andrew Savage, Keith Nale, Joe Anglim, and Tasha Fox. His intention was to surround himself with shields in the form of more vocal players such as Andrew and physical threats such as Joe. On Day 5, Andrew told the tribe a heartfelt story about how he met his wife and this made everybody cry. After the story, Jeremy left the shelter so that he could be alone. He then stated in a confessional that his wife was pregnant with their third child, so he was playing for them. Jeremy always remained on Bayon even after two tribe switches, and they won nearly all the Immunity Challenges.\n\nAfter the first tribe switch, he formed a bond with original Ta Keo member Spencer Bledsoe. On Day 9, he found a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol and found the idol during the Immunity Challenge. After Bayon lost their first, and only, Immunity Challenge, Jeremy and his allies Stephen Fishbach and Monica Padilla agreed to vote out original Ta Keo Kelly Wiglesworth. However, Kimmi Kappenberg told him that Monica tried to start an all-girls alliance, which infuriated him. As a result, at Tribal Council, Jeremy, along with Kimmi and Stephen, voted together to blindside Monica.\n\nThe tribes officially merged with 13 players remaining. Jeremy's alliance was the majority alliance over Kass McQuillen and Ciera Eastin's minority alliance. Despite being in the majority alliance with most of the original Bayons, plus Spencer and Kelly, the multitude of intertwining relationships as a result of the tribe switches resulted in everybody creating temporary voting blocs to take out common threats. Jeremy was able to find his second Hidden Immunity Idol and played it on Stephen during the final ten Tribal Council, thus sparing Stephen from elimination and blindsiding Ciera. However, Stephen was voted out at the next Tribal Council. With eight players remaining, they got to meet their loved ones. Jeremy met his wife Val Collins (whom he competed with as her loved one previously in San Juan del Sur), and she told him that they were going to have a boy. However, Jeremy stated in a confessional that he was not going to tell anyone, believing that it could jeopardize his game.\n\nWith six players remaining, Jeremy was in the majority alliance that consisted of himself, Spencer, Tasha, and Kimmi. However, Kimmi jumped ship to Keith and Kelley Wentworth's side. Spencer and Tasha warned him about Kimmi possibly flipping, but Jeremy did not believe them. At Tribal Council, both Jeremy and Kelley played their idols, each negating the three votes against them. This was the first time in Survivor history that no votes did count for anybody at Tribal Council. Jeremy, angry that Kimmi voted against him, decided to vote against her at the revote. He skipped to the voting booth and happily voted against her, which angered the jury. However, both Tasha and Kimmi were tied with three votes each. Then Jeff asked them if anyone was willing to change their votes and all of them said no. Afterwards, Jeff gave Jeremy, Spencer, Kelley, and Keith Nale two minutes to decide whether they were going to send either Kimmi or Tasha home. Otherwise, both would become immune, and Keith would be eliminated by default. Jeremy and Spencer still wanted to eliminate Kimmi. Consequently, both Kelley and Keith then decided to eliminate Kimmi, sending her to the jury so that Keith wouldn't get voted out.\n\nAfter the Tribal Council, Kelley won the final five Immunity Challenge. Back at camp, Jeremy whispered to Keith to vote out Spencer. At Tribal Council, Keith did not put out the fake idol Kelley gave him, and Jeremy stayed loyal to Spencer and voted against Keith, sending him to the jury. Later, Jeremy won the Final Immunity Challenge. Despite having an alliance with Spencer and Tasha, he very briefly considered taking Kelley to the end. However, Jeremy decided almost right away that he was going to vote out Kelley. At Tribal Council, Jeremy pretended that his vote was up in the air. In response, Spencer threatened to vote for Kelley to win and sway the jury to vote for her as well, if Jeremy were to vote him out. As planned, he honored his alliance with Spencer and voted out Kelley, making her the final member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Jeremy was praised by Stephen for his loyalty and playing with honor and integrity. However, Andrew criticized him for skipping and being arrogant during Kimmi's elimination, and Kimmi chastised him for replacing her with Spencer in their alliance. When Kelley asked the finalists what their second chance was about, Jeremy said that he was doing it for his family, including his unborn son, and that he struggled with keeping his wife's pregnancy a secret for the entire game. Ultimately, the ten jurors voted for Jeremy, making him the Sole Survivor of Survivor: Cambodia, and the fourth person to win by a unanimous jury vote.	6	2	1	9	8	3.14	39	0.15
19	Tasha Fox	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tasha_Fox	2	Tasha was one of the twenty castaways chosen by public vote to compete on the second chance season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nTasha was a part of the Bayon tribe. On Day 1, she formed an alliance with Jeremy Collins. Bayon won the first two challenges so she avoided going to Tribal Council. On Day 7, a Tribe Switch occurred. Tasha along with Andrew Savage were switched to the Angkor tribe which was the third tribe added at the tribe swap. They were joined by original Ta Keo's Woo Hwang, Abi-Maria Gomes, Peih-Gee Law, and Jeff Varner. Despite being on the bottom both Tasha and Andrew made individual deals with the original Ta Keo's to protect them. They also noticed the tension between Abi and Peih-Gee. After losing the Immunity Challenge Tasha caught Jeff trying to communicate with Kelly Wiglesworth and she called him a rat, and then Varner revealed that Andrew and Tasha had made multiple deals with the former Ta Keo members. Both Tasha and Andrew targeted Varner for elimination, but Abi wanted to get rid of Peih-Gee because of their conflict, and Peih-Gee wanted to get rid of Abi, resulting in Tasha and Savage being the swing votes. At Tribal Council, Tasha, Andrew, and Varner sided with Abi and Peih-Gee was voted off.\n\nTasha still targeted Varner after Peih-Gee's elimination. After losing their second Immunity Challenge in a row Tasha and Andrew really wanted to get rid of Varner for being a physical liability and a threat to Abi's loyalty to them but Abi wanted to target Woo for voting against her twice. At Tribal Council, Abi sided with them and Varner was unanimously voted off. Angkor finally won immunity on Day 13. The next day, another tribe swap occurred. Tasha switched back to Bayon. Bayon won the next Immunity Challenge.\n\nOn Day 17, the tribes merged. Tasha was in the majority alliance with most of the original Bayon's and former Ta Keo's Spencer Bledsoe and Kelly. Kass McQuillen attempted to strategize with Tasha, but Tasha lied to her about the Bayon alliance as vengeance for Kass betraying her in Cagayan. Kass caught on to Tasha's deception, and tried to patch things up the next morning. Tasha admitted that she didn't trust Kass, and the two discussed their feud in front of the rest of the tribe. After the Immunity Challenge, Tasha's alliance decided to split their votes between Kass and Ciera Eastin. They did that at Tribal Council. Tasha received two votes which came from Kass and Abi, but Kass was voted off. After that Tasha avoided being targeted for a while.\n\nAt the final 8, the castaways got to meet their loved ones. Tasha met her cousin, Christina. After the loved one's challenge, Tasha, Jeremy, and Spencer made a final three deal. After the Immunity Challenge, Tasha told Jeremy about the all girls alliance. At Tribal Council, Tasha received a vote from Keith Nale, but Joe was voted off. Tasha was upset at Keith for voting against her and decided to target him. However, she later decided to target Abi. At Tribal Council, Tasha, Jeremy, Kimmi Kappenberg, and Spencer voted Abi off for her volatility.\n\nAt the final 6, Tasha was a part of the majority alliance which consisted of herself, Spencer, Jeremy, and Kimmi Kappenberg. However, Kimmi flipped to Keith and Kelley Wentworth's side. Tasha and Spencer warned Jeremy but he did not believe them. At Tribal Council, all three voted for Kelley. However, Kelley played her Hidden Immunity Idol and then Jeremy played his. The idols negated the three votes cast against them which resulted in no counted votes cast against anyone for the first time in Survivor history. The second ballot was a 3-3 tie between Kimmi and Tasha. The other four told host Jeff Probst that they were not going to change their votes, thus the tie was deadlocked. Probst explained the rules: the four non-tied castaways had to unanimously decide to eliminate Kimmi or Tasha, or else the two tied would become immune; since Keith would then be the only one of the remaining four not immune, he would be eliminated by default in the rock draw tiebreaker. Jeremy and Spencer immediately said that they would not agree to eliminate Tasha, thus the only options were for Keith and Kelley to agree with them to eliminate Kimmi, or to disagree, which would eliminate Keith. Keith volunteered to leave the game in Kimmi's place, but Kelley convinced him to stay. Ultimately, Keith and Kelley chose the former, and Kimmi was eliminated. Once again, Tasha's alliance was in the majority. Both Keith and Kelley were voted off respectively. Tasha, Spencer, and Jeremy were the Final Three\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Tasha received some criticism for doing Jeremy's dirty work. However, she argued that she is a strong woman and made her own decisions like orchestrating Joe Anglim's elimination. Ultimately, Tasha became the co-runner-up along with Spencer, losing to Jeremy in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	8	0	2	8	7	4	39	0.21
18	Spencer Bledsoe	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Bledsoe	2	Spencer was one of the twenty castaways chosen by the public to compete on the second chance season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nSpencer was initially placed on the Ta Keo tribe. After they lost the season's first Immunity Challenge, the tribe immediately went to Tribal Council where Spencer joined his alliance mainly consisting of the new-school players, plus Jeff Varner and Peih-Gee Law, to blindside Vytas Baskauskas. However, after Ta Keo lost the second Immunity Challenge, both Spencer and Shirin Oskooi became the targets for playing too hard thanks to seeds that Varner planted within the rest of the tribemates. Despite their damage control efforts with Abi-Maria Gomes and Woo Hwang, Spencer and Shirin were forced to vote against each other. Luckily for Spencer, Shirin was voted out and his second chance continued.\n\nOn Day 7, a tribe switch occurred. Spencer and Kelly Wiglesworth switched to the Bayon tribe where despite being in a 4-2 minority, he bonded with Jeremy Collins. Bayon finally lost their first Immunity Challenge on Day 13. Spencer appeared to have made more connections than Kelly, but due to Monica's insistence on making an all girls alliance in the future, Spencer was very much a target still. At Tribal Council, Spencer and Kelly voted against each other, but Monica Padilla's plotting backfired as she was blindsided due to Jeremy, Kimmi Kappenberg, and Stephen Fishbach voting against her.\n\nOn Day 14, another tribe switch occurred, with Spencer and Kelly switched back to Ta Keo. Spencer and Kass were placed on the same tribe together for the first time this season, and despite his (few) efforts to mend that fence, it remained awkward between the two. In fact, Kass was very eager to send Spencer home next provided she had the numbers. After they lost the Immunity Challenge, Andrew Savage planned to blindside Spencer by telling him that Ciera Eastin was the target. However, Ciera believed that Andrew was too closely aligned with Woo and convinced Kass McQuillen and Abi-Maria to save Spencer and blindside Woo. Kass alerted Spencer about the plan, but was still of two minds as to who of her Cagayan frenemies to blindside. At Tribal Council, Spencer, Kass, Ciera, and Abi-Maria successfully blindsided Woo, leaving Savage in shock as well.\n\nOn Day 17, the tribes merged into the Orkun tribe with 13 players remaining. Spencer, Kelley Wentworth, Abi-Maria, and Kelly were the only original Ta Keo members to make it to the merge, and Spencer was the only original male Ta Keo member remaining. Spencer, along with Joe Anglim and Keith Nale, were the swing votes between the Bayon Alliance lead by Savage and Jeremy and the Witches Coven. Ultimately they sided with the former, sending Kass to the jury. Despite a then 9-3 advantage, the next few votes were anything but simple thanks to idol plays and voting blocs leading to a series of blindsides. At the climax was Spencer trying hard to convince Jeremy to vote out Stephen, to no avail as Jeremy protected Stephen with an idol to seal Ciera's fate. Despite Joe finally losing immunity on Day 29 (with Spencer winning his first individual Immunity Challenge despite several close finishes), Spencer took a gamble on keeping Joe in the game to use his vote to finally successfully eliminate the Tocantins finalist.\n\nWith 8 players remaining, the contestants met their loved ones. Spencer met his girlfriend, Marcella, and told her he loves her for the first time. After Kelley won the Loved Ones Challenge and chose Joe, Abi-Maria, Keith, and Kimmi and their loved ones to join her, Spencer, Tasha, and Jeremy made a final three deal after Spencer successfully achieved damage control after the Stephen blindside. They were in agreement that Joe had to go next, with Spencer hoping that he didn't let his only opportunity to take out Joe slip in the previous Tribal Council. Despite rumors of an all girls alliance, this trio maintained control along with Kimmi to vote out Joe and Abi.\n\nSpencer won his second individual Immunity Challenge on Day 35, and his third on Day 36. After winning immunity on Day 36, both he and Tasha noticed Kimmi strategizing with Kelley and Keith, so they believed that Kimmi had flipped, but Jeremy did not believe them. At Tribal Council, Spencer vocally announced that he, Tasha, and Jeremy were sticking together and attempted to threaten the other 3 to flip. This prompted Kelley to play her Hidden Immunity Idol, to which Jeremy replied by playing his as well. The idols both negated the three votes cast against them. In the second vote, Spencer, Jeremy, and Tasha voted for Kimmi, and the vote was tied between Tasha and Kimmi. Spencer, along with the others, told host Jeff Probst that they would not change their votes, resulting in a deadlock. Jeff tells them that if they cannot come to a decision in one minute, Kimmi and Tasha would become immune, and Keith will be eliminated by default. Jeremy and Spencer still decided not to change their votes, prompting Kelley and Keith to change their votes to Kimmi, thus eliminating her from the game.\n\nOn Day 37, the main target, Kelley, won immunity and Keith was voted out at the subsequent Tribal Council. Unbeknownst to Spencer, Jeremy stealthily misdirected Keith into targeting Spencer in case either he or Wentworth possessed an idol. Though Spencer received two votes (the first votes he received since Day 13), the trio successfully voted out Keith. On Day 38, Jeremy defeated Spencer to win the Final Immunity Challenge. Jeremy reassured Spencer and Tasha that they were safe, and Spencer confronted Kelley about the likelihood she would vote against him that night, which annoyed her. At Tribal Council, Spencer desperately told Jeremy that if he votes him out, he will vote for Kelley to win and make sure she gets enough votes to win. This caused some shock for Kelley and some of the jurors, since she was the clear underdog to survive the vote even without that plea from Spencer. Ultimately, Jeremy honored his alliance with Spencer, and Kelley was unanimously voted out.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Andrew criticized Spencer for being arrogant during the final four Tribal Council, and Kimmi called him a bully for threatening Jeremy. Despite these accusations, Spencer tried to do damage control and convince the jury that he had matured and grown as a person while playing a game deserving of victory. Kass referenced his statement from Cagayan that "Kass had a 0% chance of winning the game" and asked him why she should respect him enough to vote for him to win when he showed a lack of respect toward her. Spencer again told Kass that he is not the same person that he was his first season. Despite his best efforts, Spencer ultimately became the co-runner-up of the season along with long time two season ally Tasha, losing to Jeremy in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	9	0	3	7	8	2.29	39	0.23
17	Kelley Wentworth	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kelley_Wentworth	3	Kelley was one of twenty castaways chosen by the public to return to compete on the second chance season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nOriginally assigned to the weaker of the two starting tribes, Ta Keo, Kelley began the game with the resolve to make it further in the game than in her original season. This showed when she went on an idol hunt in the first episode, eventually finding the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol. She mustered the courage to grab the idol from the Immunity Challenge before her tribe lost and went to Tribal Council, where she joined the "new-school" half of her tribe in blindsiding Vytas Baskauskas. Her tribe went on to lose the next Immunity Challenge. Dissension within the tribe allowed Jeff Varner to take control of the tribe, causing two members of the "new-school" group, Spencer Bledsoe and Shirin Oskooi, to be placed on the chopping block. Kelley joined her tribe in splitting the votes between the two, and Shirin was voted out.\n\nThe next day brought a new twist, as the two tribes split into three. Kelley remained on the Ta Keo tribe, which would go on to excel in the three-tribe challenges. Kelley had formed a tight bond with ex-Bayon members on her tribe, while consistently trying to push Terry Deitz, an outsider, under the bus. Terry was ultimately evacuated from the game to accompany his son before the second tribe switch, where Kelley moved to Bayon. Once again, her tribe managed to win the Immunity Challenge. The merge came on the following day with thirteen castaways remaining. Kelley along with Abi-Maria Gomes, Kelly Wiglesworth, and Spencer were the only original Ta Keo members to make it to the merge. Kelley formed a bond with three women from the third revision of Ta Keo, namely Abi-Maria, Ciera Eastin, and Kass McQuillen. While Ciera and Kass wreaked havoc within Orkun, accusing Tasha Fox of duplicity, Kelley sat back and calculated her next moves. Fearing that she may find herself at the bottom, she joined the majority alliance in splitting votes between troublemakers Ciera and Kass, with Kass being voted out.\n\nThough she stuck with the majority, Kelley was far from safe. The Bayon Alliance had already put her name up in the air as a strategic threat. At the next Tribal Council, the entire tribe was surprised when Kelley played her Hidden Immunity Idol, negating a record nine votes and blindsiding Andrew Savage.\n\nDespite still being on the bottom, she kept on surviving due to the majority alliance turning on each other several times, such as when Stephen Fishbach plotted against Kelly. She was also able to find her second Hidden Immunity Idol. However, her alliance members Ciera and Abi-Maria were blindsided at the final ten and final seven, respectively. After Spencer won immunity at the final six, Kimmi Kappenberg plotted with Kelley and Keith Nale to blindside Jeremy Collins. At Tribal Council, Spencer said that he, Jeremy and Tasha were voting together. Spencer then told Kelley that she was safe. Not wanting to take a chance, Kelley played her idol and then Jeremy played his. Their idols negated the three votes cast against them, causing a revote. The revote ended in a deadlock between Kimmi and Tasha. Jeff Probst asked Keith, Kelley, Spencer, and Jeremy if they wanted to change their voted and they all said no. Jeff then told them that would have two minutes to decide if they were sending Kimmi or Tasha home, or else Kimmi and Tasha would become immune and Keith would be eliminated by default. Keith volunteered to go home, but Kelley was able to talk him out of it, forcing Kimmi to be eliminated. Kelley won the final five Immunity Challenge. After the challenge, Kelley made a fake idol and gave it to Keith to try and trick the others into keeping them. However, their plan did not work and Keith was voted out in a 3-2 vote. At the Final Immunity Challenge, Kelley was out first and this frustrated her. Jeremy ended up winning. At Tribal Council, Kelley campaigned against Spencer. Spencer then warned Jeremy that if he voted him out, he would vote for Kelley to win and sway the jury to vote for her, so she was voted out unanimously, becoming the tenth and final juror.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Kelley asked the finalists what their second chance was about and if they had achieved it. Tasha said that hers was about building better relationships with her allies, Spencer said that his was maturing from Cagayan, and Jeremy said that he was doing it for his family, including his unborn son, and that he struggled with keeping his wife's pregnancy a secret for the entire game. Ultimately, Kelley joined the rest of the jury in voting for Jeremy, who won in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	11	2	4	8	9	3.14	38	0.29
15	Kimmi Kappenberg	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kimmi_Kappenberg	2	Kimmi was one of twenty candidates chosen by the public to compete on the Second Chance season, Cambodia. Kimmi was initially placed on the Bayon tribe consisting of herself, Andrew Savage, Ciera Eastin, Jeremy Collins, Joe Anglim, Kass McQuillen, Keith Nale, Monica Padilla, Stephen Fishbach, and Tasha Fox. After the first tribe switch with the newly added Angkor tribe, Kimmi formed a close bond with Jeremy and Stephen, and after Bayon lost their first Immunity Challenge on Day 13, Kimmi told Jeremy and Stephen about Monica previously approaching her for an all-female alliance with Kelly Wiglesworth, though Jeremy was initially worried that taking her out could hurt them at the merge as it would be seen as betrayal to the Bayon Alliance. Nevertheless, Monica was voted out in a 3-2-1 vote and Kimmi would avoid Tribal Council again after a second tribe switch and Bayon's win, allowing her to reach the merge for the first time in her Survivor career.\n\nRelatively quiet at the merge, she participated in helping to blindside Kass and Ciera from her old tribe due to alliance lines shifting. At the final eight, Kimmi lobbied the idea of forming an all-girls alliance with Abi-Maria Gomes, Kelley Wentworth, and Tasha as the guys would be in the minority once Joe was voted out of the game. However this plan never happened as at the Tribal Council following Joe's elimination, Kimmi helped Jeremy, Tasha, and Spencer Bledsoe vote out Abi-Maria in a 4-2-1.\n\nOn Day 36, fearing that she would become a fourth place boot as she viewed Spencer taking her place in the alliance she had with Jeremy and Tasha, Kimmi conspired to get rid of Jeremy and Spencer with Keith and Kelley at that night's Tribal Council. Though Jeremy was warned of this deceit, he was still faithful in Kimmi's loyalty to him and she passionately feigned her allegiance. At that night's Tribal Council, Keith, Kelley, and Kimmi voted against Jeremy due to Spencer's immunity, while Spencer, Jeremy, and Tasha voted against Kelley. Much to everyone's surprise, both Jeremy and Kelley played their Hidden Immunity Idols, leaving all votes negated. Jeremy learned that Kimmi was the flipper and led the charge to get her out while proclaiming, "shame on you", with the votes tied again 3-3 for Kimmi and Tasha. The tribe learned that they had to come to a unanimous decision on Kimmi or Tasha, or else Keith would leave the game as the only one eligible to draw rocks. Though Keith initially wanted to step down to save Kimmi, Kelley talked him out of it and Kimmi was reluctantly voted out 4-0. \n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Kimmi lambasted Spencer for his rant threatening Jeremy that he would vote for Kelley and convince the jury to do the same if Jeremy chose to vote him out at the final four Tribal Council, calling Spencer a bully and saying she would teach her kids not to act like that. Kimmi then voiced her concern to Jeremy about feeling left out of the alliance when his bond with Spencer became closer, but Jeremy claimed that he had never told her that she was going to be fourth and that he was heartbroken the night Kimmi betrayed their alliance as he had faith in her loyalty. In the end, she voted for Jeremy to win, which he did in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote. 	6	0	6	8	7	0.93	36	0.17
14	Abi-Maria Gomes	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Abi-Maria_Gomes	2	Abi-Maria was one of the twenty castaways chosen by public vote to compete on the Second Chance season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nAbi-Maria started her second chance on Ta Keo. On Day 1, she lost her bracelet which she later found in Peih-Gee Law's bag; though she told the rest of her tribe that she was wary of Peih-Gee, Peih-Gee was able to clear the air. Ta Keo lost the first Immunity Challenge. They immediately went to Tribal Council. She received 4 votes which came from the old schoolers minus Jeff Varner, and Peih-Gee, but the new schoolers plus Jeff and Peih-Gee sided with her and voted out Vytas Baskauskas.\n\nAfter Tribal Council, she overheard Peih-Gee and Shirin Oskooi talking negatively about her, Abi-Maria confronted Peih-Gee, and the argument resulted in their alliance + some tribemates making fun of Abi-Maria. A vulnerable Abi-Maria was comforted by Terry Deitz, and the two aligned. The next morning, Abi-Maria and Jeff solidified their plans to switch to the old-school alliance, putting them in power. Ta Keo lost immunity. At camp Spencer Bledsoe were the targets. Shirin tried to make amends with Abi-Maria, but Abi-Maria refused. At Tribal Council, Abi-Maria helped the majority split their votes between Spencer and Shirin, and Shirin was voted out.\n\nThe next day, a Tribe Switch occurred where Abi-Maria, Peih-Gee, Jeff, and Woo Hwang were switched to the new Angkor tribe and were joined by fellow Bayons Tasha Fox and Andrew Savage. Tasha and Andrew noticed tension between Abi-Maria and Peih-Gee, and Tasha talked to Abi-Maria about siding with her and Andrew. Angkor lost immunity. At camp, Abi-Maria decided to turn on her original Ta Keo tribemates which provoked Peih-Gee, and each of the two tried to rally support to eliminate the other. At Tribal Council, Andrew and Tasha aligned with Abi-Maria and Jeff Varner, and they sent Peih-Gee home though Abi-Maria received votes from Woo and Peih-Gee. Abi-Maria was angry at Woo for voting for her for a second time. When Angkor lost immunity again, she wanted to target Woo for voting for her twice, but at Tribal Council, she joined Andrew, Tasha, and Woo in voting out Jeff.\n\nShe was switched back to Ta Keo after the second tribe switch. Ta Keo lost immunity. She was initially apart of the majority's plan to eliminate Spencer, but Ciera Eastin convinced her and Kass McQuillen to blindside Woo. At Tribal Council, Abi-Maria, Ciera, Kass, and Spencer blindsided Woo. She then became a member of the Witches Coven.\n\nAbi-Maria made it to the merge. However, she found herself in the minority along with her allies Kass, Ciera, and Kelley Wentworth. At the merged Tribal Council, she voted for Tasha, but Kass was voted out. However, at the next Tribal Council, Abi-Maria, Kelley, and Ciera blindsided Andrew with Kelley's Hidden Immunity Idol. On Day 24, Joe Anglim defeated her to win his third Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council, Bayon Alliance members Jeremy Collins, Spencer and Stephen Fishbach worked with Abi-Maria and her allies to blindside Kelly Wiglesworth. On Night 26, Abi-Maria joined the majority in splitting the votes between Stephen and Kimmi Kappenberg and targeting Stephen, but Jeremy played his idol on Stephen thus blindsiding Ciera. On Night 29, Abi-Maria received three votes, but Abi's allies stuck with her so she narrowly escaped elimination, and Stephen was blindsided.\n\nWith four men and four women remaining, Kimmi organized a women's alliance between her, Abi-Maria, Kelley, and Tasha to eliminate Joe next and then take over the game. At the Reward Challenge, the castaways were visited by their loved ones. Abi-Maria met her mother Vera. Kelley won the Loved Ones Challenge, and chose to share the reward with Abi-Maria, Keith Nale, Joe, and Kimmi. At the final 8 Tribal Council, Abi-Maria joined the majority in voting out Joe. After losing the next Reward Challenge, Abi-Maria, Jeremy, Kimmi, and Tasha discussed eliminating Keith. Later, Jeremy and Tasha asked Abi-Maria to leave so they could talk privately; she refused, which annoyed them, and they considered targeting her instead. Spencer won immunity. At camp, Kelley and Keith recruited Abi-Maria to vote against Tasha, where as Jeremy, Kimmi, and Tasha switched their target from Keith to Abi-Maria due to the latter's volatility throughout the game. Both sides believed Spencer to be with them but, at Tribal Council, Spencer voted against Abi-Maria to send her to the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Abi-Maria asked the Final Three what their most subtle move was. She voted for Jeremy who won in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	6	0	7	5	7	2.15	35	0.17
13	Joe Anglim	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Joe_Anglim	3	Joe was chosen by public vote as one of the twenty castaways to compete on Survivor: Cambodia for a second chance at Survivor.\n\nJoe was originally placed on the Bayon tribe, were he quickly adapted socially and took on the role of a provider. On Day 1, he formed an alliance with Jeremy Collins. However, Stephen Fishbach wanted to target Joe, viewing him as being similar to J.T. Thomas, to whom Stephen lost to in his previous season. Bayon won the first two Immunity Challenges, before a Tribe Switch occurred on Day 7, sending Joe, along with Ciera Eastin, Kass McQuillen, and Keith Nale to the Ta Keo tribe. Ta Keo proved to be successful, winning the next three Immunity Challenges. Around this time, Joe and his original Bayon contingent made an alliance with outsider Kelley Wentworth to target Terry Deitz. However, on Night 13, host Jeff Probst came to their camp to inform Terry that he was being pulled from the game due to his son's medical condition at home. The next day, another Tribe Switch, sending Joe, Keith, and Kelley to Bayon, with other original Bayon members Jeremy, Stephen, Kimmi Kappenberg, and Tasha Fox. Although it seemed that Kelley would be the next target due to being the only original Ta Keo member, Joe contemplated working with her as he saw her as a number following the merge. However, any plotting was put on hold when Bayon won the Final Immunity Challenge before the merge.\n\nOn Day 17, the tribes merged into the Orkun tribe. Joe, Keith, and Spencer Bledsoe found themselves in between the Bayon Alliance and the minority alliance of Ciera, Kass, Kelley, and Abi-Maria Gomes. After Joe won the first individual Immunity Challenge, Joe sided with the Bayon Alliance in taking out Kass. The following day, Joe's team won the Reward Challenge and while on the reward trip, they identified Jeremy, Stephen, Tasha, and Andrew Savage as the core of the Bayon Alliance, wanting to target Stephen next, especially after Andrew confirmed to Joe that Stephen is targeting him. When Joe again won immunity, he proposed working with Ciera, Kelley, and Kelly Wiglesworth to take out Stephen. However, the plan is shut down when word gets back to the core Bayon Alliance, leaving Joe no choice but to vote with them. At Tribal Council, the alliance targeted Kelley, but she used her Hidden Immunity Idol to save herself, sending Andrew home instead. When Joe won his third immunity in a row, plans to vote him out were again squashed. Instead, the tribe the Witches' Coven alliance of Abi-Maria, Ciera, and Kelley worked with Jeremy, Spencer, and Stephen to take out Kelly, fearing Joe's relationship with her.\n\nOver the next few days, the tribe would be battered by the heavy Cambodian rain, prompting host Jeff Probst to offer the tribe a better shelter, but only if at least half of them agreed to sit out the next Immunity Challenge. Only Joe and Keith elected to compete in the challenge, with Joe besting Keith to win his fourth immunity in a row. At Tribal Council, Joe, Keith, Spencer, and Tasha joined the Witches' Coven in splitting their votes between Stephen and Kimmi, fearing the unknown advantage that Stephen possessed. However, Jeremy played a Hidden Immunity Idol on Stephen, saving and and resulting in Ciera's elimination. When Joe finally lost an Immunity Challenge on Day 29, he was targeted by Stephen once again. At Tribal Council, Stephen used his advantage, which he revealed to be a Vote Steal, to steal Joe's vote. However, the core Bayon Alliance fatally split their votes between Joe and Abi-Maria, allowing Joe's voting bloc of Abi-Maria, Keith, Kelley, and Spencer to have enough votes to save Joe and send Stephen home instead.\n\nOn Day 30, the remaining castaways were surprised by a visit from their loved ones, including Joe's father Pat. After Kelley won the Reward Challenge, she chose to share the reward with Joe, Abi-Maria, Keith, and Kimmi, along with their respective loved ones. On the reward, Joe's dad told him that he considered him a friend, which touched Joe because his dad had been hard on him all his life. At the next Immunity Challenge, Joe again found himself fighting with Keith for immunity, which was ultimately won by Keith after Joe fainted. Medical checked on Joe after the challenge, clearing him to continue with the game. Back at camp, he proposed voting out Abi-Maria to Jeremy and Spencer since everybody wanted to take her to the end. At Tribal Council, however, Joe was eliminated in a 6-1-1 vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Joe said that his vote was still up for grabs and told Tasha that she was unaware that she played Jeremy's game, asking her to name a move that she made. Ultimately, Joe along with the rest of the jury, voted for Jeremy to win the title of Sole Survivor.	15	0	8	9	8	2.5	32	0.47
12	Stephen Fishbach	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Stephen_Fishbach	2	Stephen was chosen in a public vote to compete on the "Second Chance" season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nStephen was a member of the Bayon tribe consisting of himself, Andrew Savage, Ciera Eastin, Jeremy Collins, Joe Anglim, Kass McQuillen, Keith Nale, Kimmi Kappenberg, Monica Padilla, and Tasha Fox. Stephen was initially uneasy due to the alpha males on his tribe, seeing as it deja vu from his time on Tocantins. Stephen attempted to look for a Hidden Immunity Idol with no luck but his unease would be postponed as Bayon managed to win the first Immunity Challenge. When Savage told a heartfelt and touching story about his kids and family, Jeremy walked off alone on the beach to cry and a paranoid Stephen blurted out in front of his tribemates that he thought Jeremy was hunting for an idol. Bayon would once again win another Immunity Challenge and learned that a tribe switch with a newly added tribe was going to happen. Stephen remained on Bayon along with his original tribemates Jeremy, Kimmi, and Monica. It was during this time that Stephen's odds in the game bettered as he formed a close bond with Jeremy, who he viewed as his new J.T.. When Bayon lost their first and only challenge, Kimmi announced to Stephen and Jeremy that Monica had approached her for an all female alliance and that she was a snake in the grass. Though Jeremy wanted to get rid of Spencer or Kelly due to fear that booting Monica would cause distrust with the other Bayon members, they nevertheless stuck together and got rid of Monica in a 3-2-1 vote. The tribes would shuffle once again with Stephen and the Bayon tribe winning immunity and making the merge.\n\nAt the Final 11 individual Immunity Challenge, Bermuda Triangles, Jeff Probst announced that there would be a secret advantage for the first person to jump off their platform and reach their respective buoy. Stephen narrowly beat out Spencer Bledsoe and won the advantage, learning that it was a Vote Steal that allowed him to steal someone's vote and render them unable to vote themselves. Though Stephen was safe at that night's Tribal Council when Kelly Wiglesworth left in a 6-3-2 vote, Spencer became more paranoid about the advantage despite being Stephen's ally and rallied up votes against him, though Jeremy lobbied for Stephen due to his loyalty. At Tribal Council, Jeremy shocked everyone when he pulled out a Hidden Immunity Idol and played it on Stephen, negating 5 votes against him and sending Ciera, who received 3 votes, home in a 3-2-0 vote. This would only give Stephen an extra few days as at the next Tribal Council, Stephen and his allies decided to split their votes between Abi-Maria Gomes and Joe in case Joe had a Hidden Immunity Idol since he was vulnerable for the first time. At Tribal Council, Stephen played his Extra Vote and stole Joe's vote, but the split vote proved to be fatal as Stephen was sent home in a 4-3-2 vote with Spencer flipping due to his paranoia over the power.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Stephen applauded Jeremy for being the more honorable member of the Final Three for staying loyal to his word and asked Tasha to defend the perception that she had merely been doing Jeremy's dirty work the entire game. He also asked Spencer about his cutthroat game-play but in the end, he voted for his close ally Jeremy to win in a 10-0-0 vote.	7	0	9	8	7	3.82	29	0.24
11	Ciera Eastin	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ciera_Eastin	3	Ciera was chosen by public vote to be one of the twenty competitors in the "Second Chance" season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nCiera started on Bayon which won the first two challenges. She was switched to Ta Keo as a result of the tribe switch. Ta Keo dominated the next three challenges. However, on Night 13, her tribemate Terry Deitz left the game to be with his son. The next day, another tribe switch occurred where Ciera remained on Ta Keo. After losing the Immunity Challenge, Andrew Savage planned to target Spencer Bledsoe but made Ciera the decoy target. This scared Ciera and she believed Andrew was more loyal to Woo Hwang than her. She convinced Kass McQuillen and Abi-Maria Gomes to target Woo. Ciera got her way as Woo was blindsided.\n\nCiera made it to the merge. While Kass and Tasha Fox were fighting, Ciera told Jeremy Collins that Andrew told her he and Woo wanted to get rid of him and Joe Anglim, which Andrew denied. Ciera then became a target. At Tribal Council, Ciera voted for Andrew, received four votes, and her ally Kass was voted out. At the next Tribal Council, Ciera and her allies blindsided Andrew by using Kelley Wentworth's Hidden Immunity Idol. At the final eleven, Bayon Alliance members Jeremy, Spencer, and Stephen Fishbach worked with Ciera and her allies to blindside Kelly Wiglesworth.\n\nOn the next reward trip, Ciera proposed that Stephen should be blindsided next because of his advantage. After the Immunity Challenge, Ciera, Spencer, Kelley, Abi-Maria, Joe, Tasha, and Keith Nale agreed to target Stephen, but throw two votes on Kimmi Kappenberg in case he plays the advantage. However, at Tribal Council Jeremy played one of his idols on Stephen which negated the five votes cast against him, and Ciera was eliminated in a 3-2-0 vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Ciera voted for Jeremy to win which he did in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	11	0	10	8	9	1.9	26	0.42
10	Kelly Wiglesworth	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kelly_Wiglesworth	2	Kelly was voted into Survivor: Cambodia by the public. Initially placed on the Ta Keo tribe, Kelly formed an "old-school" alliance with Terry Deitz, Vytas Baskauskas, and Woo Hwang. The alliance vied with the "new-school" alliance of Abi-Maria Gomes, Spencer Bledsoe, Kelley Wentworth, and Shirin Oskooi for swing votes Jeff Varner and Peih-Gee Law. After Ta Keo lost the first Immunity Challenge, which Kelly felt bad about due to her role in the loss, the tribe was immediately sent to Tribal Council with no time to scramble, and Jeff and Peih-Gee decided to side with the "new-school" alliance to vote Vytas out. Days later, the "new-school" alliance unraveled thanks to Jeff flipping and mobilizing the tribe against strategic threats Spencer and Shirin, and after Ta Keo again lost at the next Immunity Challenge, Shirin was voted out.\n\nOn Day 7, a tribe switch separated the two tribes into three tribes and Kelly found herself switched to the Bayon tribe. At Bayon, Kelly bonded with Jeremy Collins and Stephen Fishbach. After Bayon won the Immunity Challenge on Day 9, Jeff tried to send a message to Kelly, but his new Angkor tribemate, Tasha Fox, caught him and called him out in front of everyone, and Jeff was voted out days later. After losing the Day 13 Immunity Challenge, Kelly was targeted by original Bayon members Jeremy, Stephen, Kimmi Kappenberg, and Monica Padilla over her fellow original Ta Keo tribemate, Spencer. However, after Monica tried to start a women's alliance, the other three original Bayon members turned on her and she was voted out, while Kelly and Spencer were left in the dark and voted against each other. Another tribe switch occurred on the following day, and Kelly was switched back to the Ta Keo tribe. After Ta Keo lost the next Immunity Challenge, Kelly, together with fellow original Ta Keo members Abi-Maria and Woo, aligned with original Bayon members Andrew Savage and Ciera Eastin to again target Spencer. However, Andrew's constant plotting alienated Abi-Maria and Ciera and they joined Spencer and Kass McQuillen in blindsiding Woo.\n\nOn Day 18, the tribes merged into the Orkun tribe. Kelly aligned with the reunited Bayon Alliance of Andrew, Jeremy, Kimmi, Tasha, and Stephen. They vied with the Witches' Coven alliance of Abi-Maria, Ciera, Kass, and Kelley for swing votes Spencer, Joe Anglim, and Keith Nale. The swing votes sided with the Bayon Alliance and Kass was voted out at the first post-merge Tribal Council for betraying the original Bayon tribe. Andrew and Joe then attempted to recruit Kelly to align with the Witches' Coven and blindside Stephen, but Jeremy vetoed the plan and the Bayon Alliance stuck together at the next Tribal Council in voting for Kelley. However, Kelley used her Hidden Immunity Idol and Andrew was sent to the jury.\n\nKelly later formed a bond with Joe, concerning Stephen, who had been targeting Joe throughout the game. After Joe won the next Immunity Challenge on Day 24, the Bayon Alliance decided to split their votes between Ciera and Kelley. However, Stephen attempted to convince Jeremy and Spencer to align with the Witches' Coven and target Kelly in order to undercut Joe. At Tribal Council, the voting bloc of Jeremy, Spencer, Stephen, and the Witches' Coven blindsided Kelly, sending her to the jury, 6-3-2.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Kelly asked the finalists the same question that Borneo castmate Greg Buis asked her 15 years prior and had lost her the game by one vote: choose a number from 1 to 10; Jeremy said 2, Tasha said 3, and Spencer said 4. Ultimately, Kelly voted for Jeremy, who won in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	5	0	11	7	8	0.56	24	0.21
9	Andrew Savage	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Andrew_Savage	2	Andrew was one of twenty castaways chosen by public vote to compete on the second chance season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nAndrew was initially placed on the Bayon tribe, where he formed an alliance with Jeremy Collins. On Day 5, he told his tribe a heartfelt story about how he met his wife, which made everyone including himself cry. When Jeremy left the shelter after hearing Andrew's story, Stephen Fishbach accused him of looking for the Hidden Immunity Idol. Andrew went to comfort Jeremy and told him that Stephen had accused him of looking for the idol, so they decided to target Stephen. Bayon won the first two Immunity Challenges. On Day 7, a tribe expansion occurred, with the tribes going from two to three. Both Andrew and Tasha Fox were switched to new Angkor tribe, where they found themselves down in numbers to the original Ta Keo tribe. Despite being on the bottom, both Andrew and Tasha made deals with the other Ta Keos to protect them. After Angkor lost the next Immunity Challenge, both Andrew and Tasha campaigned for Jeff Varner's elimination, but Abi-Maria Gomes wanted to get rid of Peih-Gee Law because of their conflict. At Tribal Council, Andrew and Tasha, along with Abi-Maria and Jeff, sent Peih-Gee home. After they lost their second Immunity Challenge in a row, Angkor voted out Jeff for being the physically weakest member.\n\nOn Day 14, another tribe switch occurred, sending Andrew, Abi-Maria, and Woo Hwang to the Ta Keo tribe where they were joined by Andrew's original Bayon allies Ciera Eastin and Kass McQuillen, as well as original Ta Keos Kelly Wiglesworth and Spencer Bledsoe. Andrew got Abi-Maria, Ciera, Kass, and Woo to target Spencer, but told them that they would tell Spencer that Ciera was the target, which made Ciera question her position in the alliance. After Ta Keo lost the Immunity Challenge, Andrew's alliance confirmed that they would target Spencer. However, Woo was blindsided when Abi-Maria, Ciera, and Kass decided to side with Spencer, leaving Andrew angry with Kass for betraying him, believing that she was no longer loyal to the Bayon Alliance.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Orkun tribe on Day 17, Andrew was reunited with Jeremy, Tasha, and his other allies. Both Andrew and Jeremy rekindled the original Bayon Alliance with Stephen, Tasha, and Kimmi Kappenberg, with the addition of Kelly. After Ciera revealed to Jeremy and Joe Anglim that Andrew and Woo discussed getting rid of them, Andrew denied saying that and targeted her. After the Immunity Challenge, Andrew wanted to vote Ciera out for the lies she had spread, but his allies wanted to target Kass. The Bayon Alliance decided to split their votes between Ciera and Kass in case Kass had a Hidden Immunity Idol, and at Tribal Council, Kass was voted out. On Day 21, Andrew overheard Stephen propose to Spencer a plan to blindside Joe, so he outed Stephen to Joe. When Joe again won immunity, Andrew and Joe recruited Kelly, as well as the Witches' Coven alliance of Abi-Maria, Ciera, and Kelley Wentworth to blindside Stephen, but Jeremy was able to talk Andrew out of it. At Tribal Council, the Bayon Alliance voted for Kelley. However, Kelley played her idol, negating the Bayon Alliance's nine votes against her and the Witches' Coven's votes sent Andrew home. While leaving, Abi-Maria told him that he at least made the jury, which annoyed Andrew and he flipped her off.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Andrew called Jeremy and Spencer arrogant for their behavior at Kimmi and Kelley's last Tribal Councils respectively. Ultimately, Andrew voted for Jeremy, who won in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	6	0	12	7	8	3.88	21	0.29
8	Kass McQuillen	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kass_McQuillen	2	Kass was one of the twenty castaways chosen by the public to compete on the Second Chance season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nKass was initially placed on the Bayon tribe, which enjoyed early success in Immunity Challenges. On Day 7, a Tribe Switch occurred, sending Kass, along with Ciera Eastin, Joe Anglim, and Keith Nale, to the Ta Keo tribe. During this time, Kass resolved to play a more social game than her previous outing in Cagayan, starting with making a birthday present for Kelley Wentworth. She aligned with Ciera, Joe, Keith, and Kelley in targeting the tribe's outsider, Terry Deitz. Any plotting was put on hold, however, as Ta Keo won the next three Immunity Challenges. On Night 13, however, host Jeff Probst arrived at their camp to announce that Terry was being pulled from the game due to his son's medical condition at home.\n\nThe next day, another Tribe Switch occurred, with Kass and Ciera remaining on Ta Keo, along with their original Bayon tribemate Andrew Savage and four original Ta Keo members: Abi-Maria Gomes, Kelly Wiglesworth, and Kass' fellow Cagayan castaways Spencer Bledsoe and Woo Hwang. After losing the next Immunity Challenge, Andrew targeted Spencer for elimination, but wanted to tell Spencer that Ciera was the target. Ciera was not pleased with being the decoy and plotted with Kass and Abi-Maria to vote Woo out because he was too closely aligned with Andrew. Despite wanting Spencer out, Kass realized that Woo was a bigger threat, so the three of them pulled Spencer in and blindsided Woo, leaving a shocked and angry Andrew vowing revenge.\n\nOn Day 17, the tribes merged into the Orkun tribe. Kass attempted to strategize with another former Cagayan castaway, Tasha Fox. However, Tasha was still wary of Kass' betrayal in their previous season and lied to her about the Bayon Alliance. Kass caught on to Tasha's deception, and tried to patch things up the next morning. Tasha admitted that she did not trust Kass, and the two discussed their feud in front of the rest of the tribe. After the Immunity Challenge, Kass and Ciera were targeted by the Bayon Alliance because of their differences with Andrew and Tasha, leaving Kass in the minority with Abi-Maria, Ciera, and Kelley. The four targeted Tasha, knowing that the Bayon Alliance would split their votes between Kass and Ciera. Thus, Kass talked to Spencer and pitched voting out Tasha, pointing out that she and Ciera had saved him at the previous Tribal Council. At Tribal Council, however, only Kass and Abi-Maria voted against Tasha, as both Kelley and Spencer voted with the Bayon Alliance, eliminating Kass in a 6-4-2-1 vote. She thus became the first member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Kass recalled when Spencer told her in Cagayan that she had "zero chance of winning the game" for betraying their alliance, and asked him why she should reward him for playing that same way; Spencer answered that it was not hypocritical as he had matured from his time in Cagayan, and Kass wished him well. Ultimately, she voted for Jeremy Collins, who won in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote. 	8	0	13	7	8	2.57	19	0.42
2	Shirin Oskooi	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Shirin_Oskooi	2	Shirin was one of the twenty castaways chosen by the public to compete on Survivor: Cambodia for a second chance.\n\nShirin was a part of the Ta Keo tribe. When Vytas Baskauskas tried to form bonds with the women, Shirin decided to target him for his perceived smugness. She later told Spencer Bledsoe and Jeff Varner that Vytas has a lot of connections. After losing the first Immunity Challenge, Ta Keo immediately went to Tribal Council, where Shirin, along with the new schoolers, Jeff, and Peih-Gee Law sent Vytas home.

3	Peih-Gee Law	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Peih-Gee_Law	2	Peih-Gee was one of twenty castaways chosen by the public to compete on the second chance season, Survivor: Cambodia. Peih-Gee was initially placed on the Ta Keo tribe. After the marooning, Peih-Gee become indirectly involved in an incident involving Abi-Maria Gomes after she found her missing bracelet in Peih-Gee's bag, implying to the rest of the tribe that Peih-Gee took it. Peih-Gee told Abi-Maria that she presumed the bag was empty because it lacked a name tag. The women agreed that the whole incident happened without intention to harm. The tribe was soon divided into two alliances of "old school" players consisting of Kelly Wiglesworth, Terry Deitz, Vytas Baskauskas, and Woo Hwang and "new school" players consisting of Abi-Maria, Kelley Wentworth, Shirin Oskooi, and Spencer Bledsoe, with Peih-Gee and Jeff Varner caught in the middle. After Ta Keo lost the first Immunity Challenge and immediately sent to Tribal Council with no time to scramble, Jeff and Peih-Gee opted to join the "new school" side of the tribe in voting out Vytas.\n\nDespite their implied friendship, Peih-Gee continued to show disdain against Abi-Maria, who caught Peih-Gee talking behind her back with Shirin. Later, Peih-Gee, Shirin, and a few others later made fun of Abi-Maria causing her to go down to the beach and cry and was comforted by Terry. After Ta Keo lost the second Immunity Challenge, Jeff convinced his alliance to join with the "old school" players in targeting Shirin and Spencer for being strategic threats and Shirin was voted out at Tribal Council.\n\nPeih-Gee's rivalry with Abi-Maria did not show signs of ceasing when a Tribe Switch was held the day after. In a random draw of buffs, Peih-Gee joined the new Angkor tribe. Upon reaching their new home, Woo wanted the former Ta Keo to use their numbers advantage to vote out former Bayon members Andrew Savage and Tasha Fox. Despite best efforts, Angkor ended up losing the next challenge. Before Tribal Council, the Ta Keo deal fell through due to Jeff being caught by Tasha trying to communicate with Kelly, now on Bayon, and called out in front of everyone, implying mistrust. Abi-Maria also realized that if she stayed with Peih-Gee and Woo, she would be on the bottom of their totem pole and told them outright she was voting with the Bayon members. At Tribal Council, Peih-Gee was blindsided, becoming the third person to leave the game in a 4-2 vote over Abi-Maria. Before leaving Tribal Council, Peih-Gee wished Woo good luck.	1	0	18	6	7	2.33	9	0.11
7	Woo Hwang	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Woo_Hwang	2	Woo was one of the twenty castaways chosen to compete on Survivor: Cambodia for a second chance at Survivor.\n\nWoo was a part of the Ta Keo tribe. After hitting the beach, he immediately set up camp along with old-school players Kelly Wiglesworth, Terry Deitz, and Vytas Baskauskas. After losing the first Immunity Challenge, Ta Keo immediately went to Tribal Council, where Woo along with the old-school players minus Jeff Varner and Peih-Gee Law voted for Abi-Maria Gomes because of her volatility. However, Vytas was voted off. After losing their second challenge in the row, Woo, along with the others, targeted Shirin Oskooi and his Cagayan castmate Spencer Bledsoe for playing too hard. At Tribal Council, they split their votes between the two and Shirin was voted off.\n\nOn Day 7, a tribe switch occurred. Woo along with Abi, Peih-Gee, and Jeff were switched to the new Angkor tribe, joined by original Bayon's Tasha Fox, who played with Woo in Cagayan, and Andrew Savage. Noting Savage's reaction to the swap, Woo told his original Ta Keo members to stick together and vote him out first. However, after losing the Immunity Challenge, both Peih-Gee and Abi targeted each other. At Tribal Council, Woo sided with Peih-Gee and voted against Abi, but Peih-Gee was voted off. Abi was upset that Woo voted for her again. After Angkor lost their second Immunity Challenge in a row, Varner was targeted for being a strategic threat but Abi wanted to vote Woo off for voting for her twice. At Tribal Council, both Jeff and Woo pledged loyalty to the majority alliance, but they chose to eliminate Varner in order to preserve Woo's strength in challenges. In big part thanks to Woo, Angkor finally ended their losing streak on Day 13.\n\nThe next day, another tribe switch occurred, with Woo and Abi switched back to Ta Keo with Andrew. They were joined by Spencer Bledsoe, Kelly Wiglesworth, Ciera Eastin, and Woo's other Cagayan castmate Kass McQuillen. After the Reward Challenge, Woo along with Andrew, Abi, Kass, and Ciera decided to target Spencer if they lost the Immunity Challenge. After losing the Immunity Challenge, they confirmed their plan to get rid of Spencer, while using Ciera as a decoy. However, Ciera was unhappy about that and worried that Woo was too closely aligned with Andrew. As such, she rallied Kass, Abi-Maria, and Spencer to blindside Woo. The campaign was successful, and Woo left the game in 14th place by a 4-3 vote.	5	0	14	6	5	1.83	16	0.31
5	Monica Padilla	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Padilla	2	Monica was one of the twenty castaways chosen to compete on the second chance season, Survivor: Cambodia. At the beginning of the game, Monica was placed on the Bayon tribe, which went on to win the first two Immunity Challenges of the season.\n\nOn Day 7, a Tribe Switch occurred. However, the castaways were caught off-guard when host Jeff Probst announced that a third tribe would be introduced into the game. In a random draw of buffs, Monica was placed on the new Bayon tribe with Jeremy Collins, Kimmi Kappenberg, Stephen Fishbach, and original Ta Keo members Kelly Wiglesworth and Spencer Bledsoe. Bayon won the first two Immunity Challenges after the switch, keeping Monica from Tribal Council. On Day 12, Monica got into an argument with Kimmi over the tribe's food resources as she believed that the tribe should not deplete their food.\n\nAfter Bayon lost the Immunity Challenge the following day. Monica wanted to vote Spencer out so that she could keep the women's numbers up and possibly form a women's alliance in the future, and mentioned the plan to Kimmi. However, Kimmi was bothered by Monica playing an individual game before the merge and alerted Jeremy and Stephen, which shocked them. At Tribal Council, Monica would abandon her plan to vote for Spencer and voted against Kelly, as her alliance wanted. However, Monica was blindsided in a 3-2-1 vote over Kelly for being untrustworthy.	4	0	16	7	5	1.2	13	0.31
16	Keith Nale	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Keith_Nale	2	Keith was one of twenty castaways chosen by public vote to compete on the "Second Chance" season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nKeith began the game on the Bayon tribe, where he aligned with fellow San Juan del Sur castmate Jeremy Collins. Bayon won the first two Immunity Challenges so Keith was safe from Tribal Council. On Day 7, a Tribe Switch occurred. Keith along with Ciera Eastin, Joe Anglim, and Kass McQuillen were swapped to the Ta Keo tribe where those four, along with original Ta Keo member Kelley Wentworth, made a final five alliance. On Night 13, original Ta Keo Terry Deitz was evacuated to be with his son. Keith along with the others wished him luck. The next day, another tribe switch occurred where Keith along with Joe and Kelley was switched back to Bayon. They won the next Immunity Challenge, and Keith reached the merge without having attended Tribal Council.\n\nAfter the tribes merged, Keith along with Joe and Spencer Bledsoe became the swing votes between the Bayon Alliance and the Witches Coven. They ultimately sided with the former. On Day 32, Keith won his first and only individual Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council, he voted against Tasha Fox, but Joe was voted out. At the next vote, Keith and Kelley voted against Tasha and believed Spencer was on their side, but Spencer flipped and Abi-Maria Gomes was blindsided. It looked like Keith and Kelley were on the outs, but after the next Immunity Challenge, Kimmi Kappenberg talked to them about blindsiding Jeremy. At Tribal Council, Jeremy and Kelley played their Hidden Immunity Idols which negated the three votes cast against them. In the revote, Keith, Kimmi, and Kelley voted against Tasha, so this resulted in a tie between Tasha and Kimmi. Jeff Probst then told the others that if they do not come to a unanimous decision, Kimmi and Tasha will become immune and Keith will be eliminated by default. Keith volunteered to leave but Kelley convinced him to stay, so Kimmi was eliminated. On Day 37, Kelley won immunity. Back at camp, Kelley made Keith a fake idol, and a paranoid Jeremy told Keith to vote against Spencer. At Tribal Council, Keith chose not to reveal the fake idol and Jeremy stayed loyal, sending Keith out of the game. \n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Keith asked Jeremy why he believes Spencer should win, and then he asked Spencer why he believes Jeremy should win. Keith ultimately gave his vote to Jeremy, who won in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	11	0	5	7	5	1.21	37	0.30
6	Terry Deitz	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Terry_Deitz	2	Terry was one of twenty castaways chosen by the public to compete on the "Second Chance" season, Survivor: Cambodia.\n\nTerry was initially placed on the Ta Keo tribe. After hitting the beach, he along with Kelly Wiglesworth, Vytas Baskauskas, and Woo Hwang set up camp, forming an "old-school" alliance. After losing the first Immunity Challenge, Ta Keo had to go to Tribal Council immediately. At Tribal Council, Terry, along with the old-school players, voted for Abi-Maria Gomes for her volatility, but Vytas was voted out after Jeff Varner and Peih-Gee Law sided with the new-school players. After Vytas' elimination, most of the tribe laughed at Abi-Maria for her behavior, resulting in her feeling alienated. However, Terry comforted her because he felt bad for her and thought that this would improve his social standing within the tribe. After losing the next Immunity Challenge, Shirin Oskooi and Spencer Bledsoe became the targets for their strategic prowess. Terry, along with the others, split their votes between Shirin and Spencer, and Shirin was voted out.\n\nOn Day 7, a tribe switch occurred. Terry and Kelley Wentworth remained on Ta Keo, but were joined by original Bayon's Ciera Eastin, Joe Anglim, Kass McQuillen, and Keith Nale. Terry and Kelley were in the minority, though Ta Keo won the next three Immunity Challenges. However, the other five aligned together and Kelley constantly threw Terry under the bus behind his back. On Night 13, host Jeff Probst came to the Ta Keo camp and told Terry that his son Danny had been hospitalized and that his wife and the doctor wanted him to come back, pulling him from the game. Terry informed his tribemates that he was leaving and they all gave him a hug and wished him luck.\n\nMonths later, after Terry returned home, Danny received a successful heart transplant. Terry revealed during the live Reunion Show that Danny is doing much better.	6	0	15	7	6	1.17	13	0.46
4	Jeff Varner	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jeff_Varner	3	Jeff was chosen from a pool of 32 candidates to be one of the 20 castaways to compete on the second chance season, Survivor: Cambodia. He was originally placed on the Ta Keo tribe, which quickly split between old school and new school players, with Jeff and Peih-Gee Law finding themselves in the middle. Although Jeff was an old school player, he wanted to prove he could succeed in new school Survivor. When Ta Keo lost the first Immunity Challenge on Day 3, Jeff and Peih-Gee voted with the new schoolers to send Vytas Baskauskas home. However, his loyalty to the group did not last as he saw how hard Shirin Oskooi and Spencer Bledsoe were playing, so he worked on turning the tribe against them. After Abi-Maria Gomes felt ostracized by the new school alliance fighting and making fun of her, they pulled Abi-Maria into the old school alliance, giving them the majority. When Ta Keo lost again, the alliance split their votes between Shirin and Spencer, and Shirin was voted out.\n\nOn Day 7, a Tribe Switch occurred that split the tribes from two to three. Jeff found himself on the new Angkor tribe with Abi-Maria, Peih-Gee, and Woo Hwang, which held the majority over original Bayon members Andrew Savage and Tasha Fox. However, Angkor was sent to live in hardship, being forced to live in a new camp without the any of the supplies that the two original tribes acquired during the marooning. After Angkor lost the next Immunity Challenge on Day 9, Jeff tried to send a message to Kelly Wiglesworth, but was caught by Tasha, who called him out in front of everyone, placing Jeff in hot water with his tribe. Despite this, the attention shifted to the continued infighting between Abi-Maria and Peih-Gee, handing the power to Andrew and Tasha. At Tribal Council, Jeff sided with Abi-Maria, Andrew, and Tasha in sending Peih-Gee home.\n\nAngkor's continued living in squalor continued to take its toll on the tribe, resulting in a complete collapse at the Day 11 Immunity Challenge. With Abi-Maria, Andrew, and Tasha still in control, the vote was narrowed down to Jeff and Woo, who argued that Jeff should be voted out because of his deteriorating physical condition and his poor challenge performance. Jeff countered by citing that he had already proven his loyalty to the tribe, while Woo had not. Ultimately, Abi-Maria put aside her grudge against Woo, and she, Andrew, and Tasha opted to keep the tribe strong and vote out Jeff 4-1.	2	0	17	4	6	4	11	0.18
1	Vytas Baskauskas	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Vytas_Baskauskas	2	In a public vote, Vytas was chosen to be one of the twenty castaways to compete on Survivor: Cambodia for a second chance.\n\nOn day 1, Vytas was placed on the Ta Keo tribe and aligned with the "Shelter" people consisting of Woo Hwang, Kelly Wiglesworth, and his brothers's Panama tribemate and former rival, Terry Deitz, who classed Vytas an honorary Old Schooler. At camp, Vytas attempted to influence the women as he did after the Tribe Switch on his first season, though this was met with less successful results, as Shirin Oskooi and Kelley Wentworth felt Vytas was being smarmy. \n\nVytas did Yoga with Wiglesworth and tried to do with the rest of the tribe, but this wasn't as well received either. At the first challenge of the season, Ta Keo was initially leading because of Keith Nale dropping a torch in the water. However, Wiglesworth struggled with getting the key from the cage. This allowed Bayon to catch up and overtake them for the win. Ta Keo was shocked when they learned they had to leave for Tribal Council immediately. At Tribal Council, Vytas voted against Abi-Maria Gomes for being volatile. Ultimately, it was Vytas who ended up being the first boot of the season in a 6-4 vote over Abi-Maria.	1	0	20	4	5	3	3	0.33

18	Michele Fitzgerald	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Michele_Fitzgerald	2	Assigned to the Beauty tribe, Michele quickly bonded with Anna Khait and Julia Sokolowski to form a women's alliance. They had considered recruiting Tai Trang as a fourth member of their alliance to gain the majority, but the girls quickly lost trust in him after they caught him searching for a Hidden Immunity Idol. However, Gondol proved to be the most dominant of the three tribes as they won the first two Immunity Challenges, putting any plans on hold. When Tai reluctantly decided to help kill the chickens, he got emotional, having his tribe comfort him except Nick Maiorano, who offered no empathy. But Nick's attitude set the girls against him as they tried to recruit Caleb Reynolds in voting Nick out. However, Gondol won the next Immunity Challenge on Day 8, once again putting plans on hold. Gondol faced their first setback on Day 9 when Caleb was medically evacuated due to heat stroke after the Reward Challenge, but Gondol managed to bounce back from his evacuation by winning the next Immunity Challenge.\n\nWhen the tribe switch occurred on Day 12, the Beauty girls were separated from each other as Michele was switched to the new Chan Loh tribe along with Nick, Anna stayed on Gondol, and Julia was exiled to the former To Tang camp. The new Chan Loh tribe won the next Immunity Challenge on Day 13, keeping Michele safe again. During the next Reward Challenge that involved releasing a set of buoys from a net, Michele struggled to release the buoys, putting Chan Loh behind and losing the challenge. Back at camp, Michele was distraught as Anna had been voted out at the last Tribal Council, and she worried that her performance in the Reward Challenge would make her a target, but Debbie Wanner assured her that she was safe and the two aligned against Kyle Jason. Nick, however, told Michele not to align with Debbie, but Michele did not appreciate Nick's patronizing attitude. Gondol then won the last Immunity Challenge before the merge on Day 16, abstaining Michele from Tribal Council once again.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Dara tribe on Day 17, Michele and Nick became potential swing votes as the Brain and Brawn alliances were vying for their votes. After Nick won the first individual Immunity Challenge on Day 19, Michele and Nick decided to join the Brawn alliance, as they felt that Jason and Scot Pollard's arrogance made them least likely to get jury votes at the end. However, before Tribal Council, host Jeff Probst and a doctor came to visit the camp to inspect injuries that the castaways sustained. This resulted in Neal Gottlieb being evacuated after he was diagnosed with a life-threatening infection and became the first member of the jury.\n\nAfter the next Immunity Challenge, Cydney Gillon approached Michele and Julia about targeting Nick for being a threat to the Brawn alliance. However, Michele and Julia debated sticking with the Brawn-Beauty coalition to target Debbie or make a bigger move by joining the Dara Women's Alliance in blindsiding Nick. At Tribal Council, Michele and Julia ultimately joined the women's alliance in blindsiding Nick, making him the second juror. The alliance initially decided to betray Julia for playing a double agent, but their plan was thwarted when Julia won immunity. Cydney and Aubry Bracco then wanted to target Debbie for her volatility after she failed to realize the fact that Jason or Scot had an idol and that Julia was playing both sides. At Tribal Council, Michele joined Aubry, Cydney, and Julia in blindsiding Debbie. After the next Immunity Challenge, the women's plan was initially to vote out Tai to flush out his idol, but Aubry tried shifting the target to Scot. At Tribal Council, Michele and Julia were left out of the plan when Tai turned on Jason and Scot, refusing to form the super idol and blindsiding Scot with Jason's idol in his possession.\n\nMichele was confused when she was left out of Scot's elimination and felt that she and Julia were on the outs. Michele and Cydney won the next Reward Challenge and chose Aubry to go with them. During the reward, Michele tried to reintegrate herself into their alliance as Aubry and Cydney wanted to take out Jason and Julia before taking out Tai for being too likable at the end. After Michele won a critical Immunity Challenge at the final seven, the majority alliance decided to target Julia over Jason for her challenge and social prowess, but Michele was worried as Julia has been her closest ally since Day 1, so Michele and Cydney debated on targeting Julia or Tai. At Tribal Council, Michele ultimately turned on Julia, sending her closest ally to the jury.\n\nAfter Julia's elimination, Michele hoped that by voting out her closest ally, she had gained trust in the majority alliance. However, Tai wanted to blindside Michele for her likability. After the Immunity Challenge, Cydney leaked Tai's scheming to Michele, forcing Michele to have to do damage control. At Tribal Council, Tai tried to throw Michele under the bus saying that she was on the bottom of the majority alliance, but Michele ratted him out about his disloyalty, mainly when he turned on Jason and Scot and how he had floated with the majority in almost every vote he was a part of. Tai used an Extra Vote advantage to cast two votes against Michele, but the majority alliance stuck to their original plan in sending Jason to the jury.\n\nFollowing Jason's elimination, Joe del Campo won the next Reward Challenge and chose to share the reward with Aubry and Cydney. Back at camp, Michele and Tai made amends and planned to target Aubry. However, unknown to her, when Aubry returned to camp the next morning, Aubry made amends with Tai and decided to go to the end with Joe, while Michele and Cydney teamed up against Aubry and Joe. However, Joe started feeling ill as a result of feasting at the last reward. After his condition started getting worse, the medical team decided to pull him from the game.\n\nAfter Joe was evacuated, Michele was targeted by Aubry and Tai for her close personal relationships with the jury. After Aubry won the final four Reward Challenge, she chose to share the reward with Cydney to try to weaken Michele for the Final Immunity Challenge. Back at camp, Michele tried to convince Tai to break up Aubry and Cydney's partnership. At the Final Immunity Challenge, Michele came from behind to win immunity, thwarting Aubry's plan. Michele and Cydney then decided to target Aubry as they felt that she was the best likely speaker going into the Final Tribal Council and tried to get Tai to flip. At Tribal Council, Michele and Cydney stuck to their plan voting Aubry, but Tai switched his vote to Cydney, forcing a tie and causing a fire-making tiebreaker to occur. Aubry won the challenge, making Cydney the final jury member, and making Michele, Aubry, and Tai the Final Three.\n\nMichele then won an unprecedented final Reward Challenge on Day 38, which gave her the right to deny a juror of their voting rights. She considered removing Joe for his unfaltering loyalty to Aubry, Neal for his loyalty to Aubry and persuasiveness, or Scot being the victim of Tai's biggest move in the game. Aubry campaigned hard for Scot to be eliminated, knowing that Joe and Neal were her guaranteed votes. At Tribal Council, Michele ultimately voted Neal out of the jury, feeling that he could easily persuade the jury into voting Aubry. Before leaving Tribal Council, Neal said some harsh words to Michele to try and throw her off her case going into the Final Tribal Council.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Michele was reprimanded for coasting during the pre-merge, but was praised for working her way back into the majority after Scot's elimination by turning on Julia and winning two Immunity Challenges. Scot openly advocated for Michele, citing that Aubry's game became less impressive near the end while Michele finished strong. Michele's social game ultimately helped her beat out Aubry and Tai in a 5-2-0 vote, becoming the Sole Survivor of Survivor: Kaôh Rōng.	13	0	1	8	7	4.07	39	0.33
17	Aubry Bracco	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Aubry_Bracco	3	Assigned to the Chan Loh "Brains" tribe, Aubry was initially overwhelmed by the experience and considered quitting the game. But after some words of encouragement from her tribe, Aubry proved to be a dominant force, winning the first Immunity Challenge for her tribe. She did not attend Tribal Council until Day 9 after Chan Loh narrowly lost the third Immunity Challenge.\n\nAt that point, she found that her former allies, Liz Markham and Peter Baggenstos, had been plotting against her and Neal Gottlieb. Debbie Wanner took advantage of the situation and leaked the information to Aubry. Aubry and Neal decided to join up with Debbie and Joe del Campo in executing a split vote plan to blindside either of the deceitful duo. When it came time to decide which of the two to target first, Aubry was more worried about Peter long term, though he was stronger in challenges than Liz. At Tribal Council, Aubry made the right decision to join with her new allies. Even though Liz and Peter had cast their votes against her, Debbie, Joe, and Neal saved her by blindsiding Liz to leave Peter on the bottom of the tribe. Chan Loh won the next Immunity Challenge and remaining in tact with five members until the swap.\n\nOn Day 12, the tribes switched. Aubry was separated from most of her allies and was placed on the new Gondol tribe with Joe and nonaligned Peter. The three Brains decided to put their past conflict aside in order to blindside Anna Khait at Gondol's first Tribal Council so as to prevent the Beauties from gaining a numbers advantage due to Julia joining the tribe that would lose the next challenge. Gondol won the next Reward Challenge but lost the Immunity Challenge due to Peter's poor stacking strategy.\n\nThe Gondol Alliance approached Aubry for her vote by throwing Peter under the bus. Aubry contemplated flipping, but her ally Joe was adamant about sticking to tribal lines despite having been targeted by Peter and Aubry found herself as the swing vote between Julia Sokolowski and Peter. At Tribal Council, she initially wrote Julia's name down, but infamously struck it out, ultimately changing her vote to Peter. This not only created tension between her and Joe but also between her and the Gondol Alliance, which she had just helped. Scot Pollard found her to be overly fickle and vowed to get either of the surviving Brains out at Gondol's next possible opportunity. Fortunately for Aubry, the tribes merged into the Dara tribe the very next day, allowing her to be reunited with allies Neal and Debbie.\n\nHowever, Debbie utilized strong-arm tactics in order to get the Beauties to vote with the Brains, and this alienated the entire group of Brains. The Beauties decided to gang up with the Brawns and set their eyes on Aubry and Neal. Aubry failed to win immunity, and she prepared for the worst. However, Neal was evacuated due to a knee infection. Despite being saved for that vote, Aubry was devastated that her main ally in the game had been taken away from her and that he had departed without passing on his Hidden Immunity Idol to her.\n\nThe remaining Brains trio seemed to be facing insurmountable odds. To make matters worse, Aubry's team lost the following Reward Challenge, which served to cripple her morale even more. She recouped, however, and was thankful for the miracle which came when Cydney Gillon grew paranoid of her own alliance. Cydney decided to form a women's alliance, and the Brains were given a new lease on life. At Dara's first Tribal Council, Nick Maiorano was shocked by his blindside, which left the remaining men other than Joe surprised and Scot and Jason in particular looking for revenge. The turn of events opened a rift between the women and the men of the tribe. Aubry was shocked when Julia showed openness to the prospect of flipping to the less likable group of men, who had burned their bridges with their antics. Aubry led a charge against her, but her plan was thwarted by Julia's immunity win. She saw that Debbie was feeding information to the double agent, and shifted the target to her (though needing her then target Julia's help), resulting in yet another blindside.\n\nAubry later formed a close relationship with Tai Trang and was able to convince him to abandon his alliance by pointing out the lack in personality similarities between the easy going and likeable Tai compared to the tougher exteriors in Scot and Jason. Aubry's connection with Tai immediately paid off by withholding his Hidden Immunity Idol, blindsiding Jason and Scot when the latter looked to Tai for protection. Not only did this prevent Aubry from being voted out due to the Super Idol, but this also allowed Aubry's alliance to take Julia and Jason out in the next two Tribal Councils.\n\nAt the final five, Aubry ostracized Michele Fitzgerald when she picked long-time ally Cydney for the reward - a trip to a spa - which Joe had won. While the three enjoyed their reward, Joe gorged excessively on the meats. This came back to haunt him when he was ailed by an issue with his urinary tract. Aubry faced déjà vu when Joe was pulled from the game, losing yet another close ally to an untimely evacuation, and making her friendship with Tai that much more vital to surviving the next vote should she not win immunity.\n\nAubry won the final four Reward Challenge and opted to take Cydney with her on the reward. Michele and Tai plotted against them while they enjoyed their meal. Aubry and Cydney decided to dispose of Michele - a major jury threat - with Tai's help. However, when Michele won immunity, they had to turn on each other. Michele and Cydney were in agreement that Aubry was the bigger threat than Tai. However, Aubry secured Tai's support, and he was able to force a tie. Aubry and Cydney competed in a fire-making tiebreaker, and a victorious Aubry emotionally eliminated Cydney. However, she was glad to find herself in the Final Three.\n\nMichele won the final Reward Challenge, which gave her the right to deny a juror of his or her voting rights. Aubry campaigned for Scot's ouster in order to keep her two guaranteed votes - Neal and Joe - on the jury box. Ultimately, Michele decided to remove Neal, who she found to be an eloquent and avid supporter of Aubry.\n\nAubry entered Final Tribal Council as a major strategist of the season. However, the jurors deemed Aubry's social connections with them to be severely lacking in comparison to Michele's. Scot openly advocated for Michele citing that Aubry's game became less impressive near the end while Michele finished strong. Aubry earned Joe and Nick's jury votes but lost to Michele in a 5-2-0 final vote.	6	0	2	6	8	5	39	0.15
16	Tai Trang	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tai_Trang	2	Tai started on the Gondol tribe. While on the boat, he grabbed a chicken which he brought to camp; he later christened this chicken "Mark", after series producer Mark Burnett. He later searched for the Hidden Immunity Idol but was caught, which made the women in his tribe not trust him. He looked for the idol again on Day 4 but was unsuccessful. Tai also formed a bond with Caleb Reynolds during the early stages of the game. In one instance, he playfully tried to kiss Caleb, but Caleb backed away. Tai finally found the tribe's Hidden Immunity Idol on Day 7 and learned that two idols can be combined to form a super idol. At a brutal Reward Challenge on Day 9, Caleb was medically evacuated for heat exhaustion. Tai cried for his friend and worried about being outnumbered by the women on the tribe.\n\nTai remained on Gondol after the tribe switch along with Anna Khait. They were joined by original Chan Loh members Aubry Bracco, Peter Baggenstos, and Joe del Campo and lone original To Tang member Scot Pollard, who Tai formed a bond with. After Gondol lost immunity on Day 13, Tai and Anna recruited Scot to get rid of Peter for his arrogance. Tai revealed his idol to Anna and Scot, and planned to use it that night to forgo the tie. However, Scot knowing Tai and his original To Tang ally Kyle Jason both had idols, managed to turn Tai on Anna. Tai voted against Anna and did not play his idol on her, leaving Anna blindsided. Julia Sokolowski then joined Gondol the next day. Peter plotted with Tai and Scot to eliminate Joe. After Gondol lost immunity again, Peter told Scot and Tai that they should switch the target to Julia. However, this made them target Peter and he was blindsided at Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 17, the tribes merged into the Dara tribe. Debbie Wanner approached Tai for an alliance with the Brains, but her brazen attempt caused him to not align with her. Tai, along with the rest of the Beauties, planned to stick with the Brawns to split their votes between Aubry and Neal Gottlieb. However, Neal was medically evacuated, and Tribal Council did not take place. Tai won the next Immunity Challenge on Day 22. At Tribal Council, he voted for Jason, but his ally Nick Maiorano was blindsided. After Tribal Council, Jason and Tai revealed their idols to each other. As revenge for the women's alliance blindsiding Nick, Jason and Scot attempted to sabotage the camp, making Tai uncomfortable with their alliance. At the next Tribal Council, Jason gave his idol to Tai, but Tai did not play either of them. They voted for Cydney Gillon, but Debbie was blindsided.\n\nTai gave back Jason's idol after Tribal Council. At the next Reward Challenge, Tai defeated Aubry and Cydney for an advantage. The advantage turned out to be an Extra Vote, which he could use up until the final five. Aubry tried to get Tai on her side, which he considered because he felt alienated by his allies. After the Immunity Challenge, Tai, Jason, and Scot planned on forming the super idol at Tribal Council. However, Aubry managed to convince Tai to side with her. At Tribal Council, Tai voted for Scot and did not give him his idol so he was blindsided with Jason's idol in his pocket.\n\nTai tried to rationalize his betrayal to Jason, explaining that he was afraid that he and Scot were going to betray him, but it failed to diffuse Jason's anger. At the next Tribal Council, Tai received votes from Jason and Julia, but Julia was voted out. After Julia's elimination, Tai revealed his advantage to Aubry and Joe. Tai decided to take out Michele Fitzgerald for her likability. He later reinforced his desire to vote for Michele, but Cydney was unhappy with Tai's bossiness. He told Jason to vote for Michele, but Jason did not believe he had the power. At Tribal Council, Tai used his Extra Vote advantage on Michele, but the rest of Tai's alliance voted Jason out.\n\nAfter Jason's elimination, Tai tried to make amends with his alliance after he was left out of the plan, and he confronted Aubry about her betrayal. Joe won the Reward Challenge and chose to share the reward with Aubry and Cydney. Back at camp, Tai and Michele made amends and planned to target Aubry. However, after returning to camp the next morning, Aubry reconciled with Tai, and the two decided to go to the end with Joe. However, their plans were put on hold when Joe was medically evacuated.\n\nAubry and Tai agreed to target Michele next. However, Michele talked to Tai about splitting up Aubry and Cydney. After Michele won immunity on Day 37, Aubry changed her target to Cydney and pleaded with Tai to vote with her and force a tie, while Michele and Cydney proposed getting rid of Aubry as the best likely speaker in front of the jury. At Tribal Council, Tai voted against Cydney, forcing a tie between her and Aubry. Aubry defeated Cydney in the fire-making tiebreaker to send Cydney to the jury, making Aubry, Michele, and Tai the game's three finalists.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Tai was criticized for his erratic gameplay and misplaying his advantage. At the end of the Final Tribal Council, Tai finally let Mark go. He ultimately became the second runner-up, receiving no jury votes. He lost to Aubry, who was the runner-up with two votes and Michele, who was declared the Sole Survivor with five votes.\n\nDuring the Reunion Show, Australian singer Sia came on stage and donated $50,000 to Tai, and another $50,000 to his choice of animal charity in order to thank him for showing America how to be kind to animals.	11	2	3	7	8	5.29	39	0.28

4	Caleb Reynolds	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Caleb_Reynolds	2	Caleb was initially placed on the Gondol tribe consisting of people who rely mostly on their looks and social skills. Despite Caleb's initial confusion towards Tai Trang's placement on the tribe, the two quickly became friends. Caleb's friendship with the women on the tribe, as well as the women's distrust in Nick Maiorano, helped him to evade the target. Gondol enjoyed a period of challenge dominance and did not have to go to Tribal Council prior to the tribe switch in part due to Caleb's challenge strength. However, his game was cut short when a brutal and physical Reward Challenge in the Cambodian heat on Day 9 resulted in Caleb suffering from heat stroke that necessitated his medical evacuation from the game.	4	0	15	8	7	1.5	9	0.44

10	Debbie Wanner	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Debbie_Wanner	2	It took a while for Debbie to settle in to her original tribe (Chan Loh), but she successfully gathered the more quirky members Aubry Bracco, Neal Gottlieb, and Joe del Campo to align against the overconfident duo of Liz Markham and Peter Baggenstos, resulting in the former's blindside on Day 8. On the Day 9 Reward Challenge, Debbie got overheated and needed medical attention, though she was able to recover.\n\nFollowing a swap on Day 13, Debbie and Neal found themselves in a struggle for power against To Tang for vital swing votes Gondol members Nick Maiorano and Michele Fitzgerald. All plans were forced to be put on hold for a long time as Debbie's tribe won every Immunity Challenge after the swap and Neal's evacuation cancelled Tribal Council right after the merge. Neal's evacuation initially seemed to prompt Gondol to side with Brawn, but To Tang member Cydney Gillon wanted to make a move against the men who were trying to control the game. The women plus Joe succeeded in voting out the overconfident Nick. Finally back in a power position, Debbie wanted to control her alliance. Aubry became frustrated with Debbie because not only did she fail to consider that minority alliance members Scot Pollard or Kyle Jason might have an idol, but also that their ally Julia Sokolowski was trying to play both sides. This frustration eventually lead to Aubry, Michele, Julia, and Cydney targeting Debbie. At Tribal Council, Debbie along with Joe voted for Scot, but she was blindsided as Michele, Aubry, Cydney and Julia voted against her, sending her home 4-3-2.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, despite seeming closer to Aubry throughout the game, she voted for Michele to win the title of Sole Survivor, which she did in a 5-2-0 vote.	7	0	9	6	5	2.89	24	0.29

20	Adam Klein	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Klein	2	Adam began the game on the Millennials tribe, Vanua. He seemed to be in a good position as the Triforce alliance prompted the formation of a counter-alliance that he was a part of. However, Michelle Schubert led the charge to cause three members of the "misfits" to flip and join her Triforce in blindsiding Mari Takahashi, leaving Adam and Zeke Smith on the outs. Both of them were upset with Hannah Shapiro after Tribal Council despite her desire to work with them in the future. Now in a vulnerable position, Adam tried to regroup the remnants of his alliance and found Vanua's Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nAfter the tribe switch, he was put on Takali with Millennials Figgy Figueroa and Taylor Stocker and Gen-Xers Ken McNickle and Jessica Lewis. At their only Tribal Council visit, knowing how powerful Figgy and Taylor were, Adam took the opportunity to blindside Figgy. This would cause Taylor to target him for the rest of the game, though Adam was unaware of Taylor's grudge against him.\n\nAt the merge, Adam found an advantage that allowed him to steal someone's reward. Later that night he attempted to build trust with Taylor by telling him about his advantage and advising him to target Will Wahl. Taylor however used the latter to turn the merged tribe against Adam. Despite Adam's paranoia after Will won the Immunity Challenge, which caused his own allies to distrust him, his alliance protected him by voting out Michelle, though Adam received four votes from the Triforce. Adam continued to worsen his position by arrogantly telling Jay Starrett that he was on the bottom, further angering his allies. At the next Tribal Council, Taylor attempted to turn the majority on Adam by lying about Adam eating the food Taylor stole and revealing the latter's advantage, which Adam confirmed. However, Adam was saved again and Taylor was voted out.\n\nAfter that, the decisions got tougher as sub alliances began jockeying for position. Adam joined David Wright's alliance in blindsiding Chris Hammons at the next Tribal Council. At the final ten, Adam told David to play his Hidden Immunity Idol on Ken after Sunday Burquest lied to him about Ken being the target, which resulted in a tie between Hannah and Zeke. Then a rock drawing tiebreaker occurred, where Jessica picked the black rock and was sent to the jury.\n\nAt the family visit, Adam met his brother Evan. He then announced that he has an advantage to steal a reward, but will not use it. Jay won the challenge and chose to share the reward with Will, Sunday, and Adam. Evan shared information about their mother's battle with cancer. To show his gratitude to Jay for sharing the reward with him, Adam gave Jay the Reward Steal. Adam won the next Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council, he played his idol on Hannah, which negated the four votes at against her, but it was unneeded as Will had flipped and Zeke was blindsided. On Day 34, Adam decided to target Will because he was trying to play both sides. Adam's plan worked as Will was blindsided. After Ken won immunity at the final seven, Adam wanted to split the votes between David and Jay to eliminate both Jay's idol and a major threat to win. However, Hannah wanted to vote out Sunday, leaving Adam conflicted. He told Jay to play his idol, and confided in him about his mother's cancer battle. At Tribal Council, Adam sided with Hannah and Sunday was blindsided. On Day 36, Adam, David, Hannah, Bret LaBelle, and Ken blindsided Jay. On Day 37, Ken won immunity. Adam and Bret decided to target David; Adam then searched for an idol, which he found. He told Hannah about his new idol and plan to eliminate David. At Tribal Council, Adam played the idol on himself but received no votes and Hannah and Ken sided with David, blindsiding Bret and leaving Adam shocked. On Day 38, Ken won the Final Immunity Challenge. Knowing he and David were the targets, Adam practiced for a possible fire-making tiebreaker, but at Tribal Council, Ken sided with Adam and Hannah and David was blindsided.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Adam and Hannah argued about strategic decisions, and Adam finally admitted to the entire jury about his mother having cancer. Believing he played the best strategic and social game amongst the finalists, the jury of 10 unanimously voted for Adam to win the title of Sole Survivor, making him the fifth winner to win unanimously.	8	2	1	8	9	3.79	39	0.21
17	David Wright	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/David_Wright	2	Starting off on the Takali tribe, David immediately came out as paranoid and small. His paranoia got to him early on and David made an attempt to find a Hidden Immunity Idol early on, but was unsuccessful and raised his tribemates' suspicion, causing him to be on the bottom of his tribe. He only succeeded in making some level of bond with Ken. After Takali lost the first Immunity Challenge on Day 4, David was certain that he was going home. He plead his case to the majority Takali Alliance, who decided to keep him and instead voted out Rachel Ako. The following day, David made another attempt to find the idol, and this time, was successful. The next day, David officially formed an alliance with Ken McNickle who he bonded with initially, and cemented their trust by showing Ken his idol.\n\nOn Day 8, a twist was introduced that had four people from each tribe come to a summit to represent their tribe. David went for Takali, along with CeCe Taylor, Chris Hammons, and Paul Wachter. During that summit, David noticed Paul's desire to always be the center of attention. He viewed Paul as the biggest obstacle to breaching the alliance in power, and even admitted it would not have been the worst-case scenario for his game if Paul was evacuated due to the heart attack Paul suffered at camp. On Day 10, David's alliance of himself, CeCe, and Ken planned to blindside Paul alongside Jessica Lewis, Lucy Huang, and Sunday Burquest following Paul inadvertedly straining his trust with Jessica. At that Tribal Council, a confident Paul was blindsided. After this move, the majority alliance planned to blindside Jessica, and Lucy attempted to take control of the vote, telling David and Ken what they would do. This move led David's alliance planning to blindside Lucy. At the Reward Challenge, David shocked everyone with his excellent performance and scoring the winning point for Takali. However, Takali lost the succeeding Immunity Challenge. For the first time David was not an immediate target, with Cece, Jessica, and Lucy all higher on people's radars due to either challenge performances or recent actions. David and Ken were forcefully approached by Lucy to vote out Jessica, so they warned Jessica to no avail since she believed her alliance would vote out Cece. At Tribal Council, David played his idol for Jessica, sending Lucy home.\n\nWith the knowledge that David's idol had been rehidden, the Takali tribe scrambled across camp to try and find it and David ended up finding it once again. Later that day, a Tribe Switch occurred, and David, CeCe, and Chris moved to the Vanua tribe, joining Michelle Schubert and Zeke Smith. After losing the next Immunity Challenge in which both David and Cece really struggled (much to Zeke's frustration as part of the minority with his game on the line), the Gen-Xers planned to vote out Michelle. Chris however bonded with Zeke over their ties with University of Oklahoma football (Chris as a player and Zeke as a fan) and knew he had to take out one of David's numbers. David was faced with a tough decision as to whether he should go with the majority against Cece or play yet another idol and save her. Ultimately David kept his idol and let Cece be voted out.\n\nOver the next few days, David grew closer to Zeke, and even showed Zeke his idol to gain his trust. At the Reward Challenge on Day 16, David nearly cost his tribe the challenge. Despite this, they ended up finishing first. They would later follow a winning streak, winning the next three challenges. When the tribes merged into the Vinaka tribe on Day 21, a super-majority alliance was formed with David's alliance with Jessica and Ken, the majority Takali Alliance remnants of Chris, Sunday, and Bret LaBelle, and Zeke's minority millennial alliance with Adam Klein and Hannah Shapiro, going against the Triforce alliance of Michelle, Jay Starrett, Taylor Stocker, and Will Wahl. The three alliances banded together, eliminating Michelle and Taylor in the next two Tribal Councils.\n\nAt the Reward Challenge on Day 26, David mentioned that he thought no one would want him on his team because he of his poor swimming abilities. Despite this, everyone encouraged him to draw for a team, though David's team ended up losing the challenge. However, David won the next Immunity Challenge, to everyone's surprise. Despite David's success both in this challenge and the ensuing vote, this would be where David's threat status begins to emerge.\n\nDespite successfully voting out Michelle and Taylor, the super-majority still had cracks in it, with Chris still targeting Jessica. David's alliance responded by teaming up with the minority to vote out Chris. After Chris' blindside, David told Bret and Sunday that even though he voted out Chris, it did not mean that he wanted them to go next. He later mentioned to them that he thought that Zeke was playing the best game, and that he should go next. Bret exposed this to Zeke, and the two aligned with Jay, Sunday, and Will to attempt to vote out David. However, in order to avoid a possible idol play by David, they decided to target Hannah. Zeke's former allies Adam and Hannah, however, teamed up with David, Jessica, and Ken, leaving the two alliances against each other. At the next Tribal Council, Bret and Zeke insulted and made fun of David's anxiety, which David described as a personal attack. Sunday's misdirection prompted Adam to tell David to play his idol for Ken, which ended up misfiring. After a tie between Hannah and Zeke forced a rock draw tiebreaker, David ended up losing Jessica, one of his closest allies.\n\nDespite his alliance being outnumbered, Will approached David, saying that he was ready to blindside Zeke. David's alliance settled, and at the next Tribal Council, Will went with them and voted out Zeke (though Adam played his idol on Hannah just to be safe). After this move, more people were becoming paranoid of David, and Will attempted to get everyone to vote him out. However, Bret and Sunday joined David's alliance in voting out Will at the following Tribal Council, frustrated with the 18 year old's rash decision to flip on Zeke. The next day, both Adam and Jay plotted to eliminate David. However, Hannah managed to convince Adam to remain loyal, and the alliance instead voted out Sunday who Hannah was worried would take one of their spots at Final Tribal Council due to Sunday's status as a goat in Hannah's eyes.\n\nOn Night 35, David stayed up making a fake Hidden Immunity Idol and hid it, with Jay finding it the next morning. On Day 36, David claimed his second individual immunity, and a steak dinner reward. Jay used his Reward Steal advantage to steal the reward, but still picked David to join him, as well as Adam. At the reward, the three discussed the topic of who to vote out, and if the three should stick together for the Final Three. At Tribal Council, Jay played David's fake idol, while everyone else came together to send Jay out of the game.\n\nWith Jay gone, Adam began to separate from David's alliance and grew closer to Bret. The two attempted to get Hannah to flip on David. Despite this, Hannah stayed on David's side and voted out Bret, with Bret warning the others that they only had one shot left to take out David or that he would win. On Day 38, Adam and Hannah were both ready to blindside David, but while it seemed like David and Ken were settled on voting out Adam, Hannah convinced Ken to flip, and David was blindsided by his entire alliance.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, David asked the finalists what their motivation was for playing Survivor. In the end, David voted for Adam, who won in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	9	2	4	8	9	4	38	0.24

7	Michaela Bradshaw	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Michaela_Bradshaw	2	Michaela started the game on the Vanua tribe consisting of millennials. On Night 5, she caught Figgy Figueroa and Taylor Stocker kissing in the shelter and outed them the next day. Michaela made her dislike of Figgy very clear, and the two got into an argument. After Vanua lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 7, Michaela aligned with Adam Klein, Hannah Shapiro, Mari Takahashi, Will Wahl, and Zeke Smith in targeting Figgy. However, fearing that his Triforce alliance would lose the numbers, Jay Starrett got Michaela and Figgy to make amends. At Tribal Council, Michaela and Will joined the majority in blindsiding Mari.\n\nWhen the tribe switch occurred on Day 13, Michaela, along with Hannah, Jay, and Will were switched to the Ikabula tribe, where they were joined by original Takali members Bret LaBelle and Sunday Burquest. On Ikabula, Michaela managed to start the tribe's fire, and later caught Jay and Will finding a Hidden Immunity Idol, though she promised not to rat them out. After Ikabula won the Immunity Challenge on Day 18, Michaela openly coached the Vanua tribe to a second-place finish, reasoning that she wanted to keep the millennials together.\n\nAfter Ikabula finally lost on Day 20, Michaela told her old Vanua tribemates that they should split their votes between Bret and Sunday in case one of them had an idol and vote out Bret on the revote. However, Jay and Will were scared of Michaela's athleticism, intelligence, and the fact that she knew about their idol. At Tribal Council, Jay and Will sided with Bret and Sunday and blindsided Michaela. Shocked, she screamed and asked Jay if he voted against her, which he confirmed. When leaving Tribal Council, she angrily struck a tree on her way out. Despite her infuriation with Jay, she did not reveal that he had the idol.	7	0	14	7	6	2.14	20	0.35
11	Jessica Lewis	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jessica_Lewis	1	Jessica was a part of the Takali tribe. During the scramble, Jessica found an envelope. At camp, she learned that she had found a Legacy Advantage, which would give her an unspecified advantage in the game on Day 36; if she were voted out before then, she would privately will it to someone else following her elimination. When Takali lost the first Immunity Challenge, she became a part of the Takali Alliance, and aided the alliance in voting out Rachel Ako. When Takali lost immunity on Day 10, the alliance planned to vote out CeCe Taylor. However, when alliance member Paul Wachter told her that he would align with men over women, Jessica alerted female alliance members Sunday Burquest and Lucy Huang, and at Tribal Council, they sided with the minority alliance of David Wright, Ken McNickle and CeCe and blindsided Paul. However, Jessica was blamed for this move, so she was kicked out of the alliance and made the target, but she was unaware of this. Takali lost immunity again. At camp, Ken told Jessica that Lucy was targeting her, but she did not believe him, and told Lucy. At Tribal Council, she voted for CeCe, David played his Hidden Immunity Idol on her, and David's and CeCe's votes sent Lucy out of the game. After Tribal Council, Jessica made amends with Ken and promised to give him the advantage if she was voted out.\n\nThe next day a Tribe Switch occurred. Jessica and Ken remained on Takali and were joined by Vanua members Figgy Figueroa, Taylor Stocker, and Adam Klein. It appeared Jessica and Ken were in the minority. When Takali lost immunity, Adam was caught in the middle, but he ended up siding with Jessica and Ken thus blindsiding Figgy.\n\nJessica reached the merge. She along with David's alliance, the Vanua outsider alliance and her old alliance worked together for the first two votes after the merge. However, on Day 30, her original alliance member Chris Hammons plotted for her elimination. After losing the Reward Challenge, David talked to her and Ken about blindsiding Chris. At Tribal Council, Jessica received four votes, but Chris was successfully blindsided. She then became a part of David's Vinaka Alliance. At the next Tribal Council, she, along with her allies, voted for Zeke Smith, but the vote ended in a 5-5 tie between Zeke and her new alliance member Hannah Shapiro. She considered switching her vote to Hannah because she did not want to participate in the rock drawing tiebreaker, but she ended up sticking with her alliance and voting for Zeke in the revote, and the vote ended in a 4-4 tie between Zeke and Hannah. Nobody would change their votes so the rock drawing tiebreaker took place. Jessica unfortunately picked the wrong rock and was eliminated, with some of her tribemates blaming David for the rock drawing. She finished 10th. She willed her legacy advantage to Ken.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Jessica castigated Ken for preaching honor and loyalty, but only to vote out his number one ally David. She voted for Adam to win which he did in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	4	1	10	7	8	1.73	30	0.13
12	Zeke Smith	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Zeke_Smith	2	As a Millennial, Zeke started the game on the Vanua tribe. He led the tribe in building the shelter on Day 1. After Vanua lost their first Immunity Challenge on Day 7, Zeke targeted Figgy Figueroa. At Tribal Council, Zeke, Adam Klein, and Mari Takahashi voted against Figgy, but the rest of the tribe blindsided Mari. After returning from Tribal Council, Hannah Shapiro tried to explain to Zeke why she voted against Mari, but Zeke was angry and told her to leave him alone. While Zeke was on the outs, he was spared when Vanua won the next two challenges.\n\nBoth Zeke and Michelle Schubert remained on Vanua after the Tribe Switch. While they appeared to be in the minority, original Takali members Chris Hammons and David Wright sided with them and blindsided their fellow original Takali, CeCe Taylor, at their first Tribal Council after the switch. On Day 19, David showed Zeke his Hidden Immunity Idol in order to gain his trust.\n\nZeke managed to reach the merge, becoming a member of the Vinaka tribe. He regrouped with Hannah and Adam, and they all gave each other information from their respective post-switch tribes. However, Zeke considered targeting Adam because he was untrustworthy, though he ended up sticking with him.\n\nOn Day 26, Chris approached Zeke about blindsiding Jessica Lewis and he agreed. David won the next immunity and at camp, Zeke and Hannah were caught in the middle between Chris's alliance, who targeted Jessica, and David's alliance who targeted Chris. Zeke and Hannah ended up siding with David's alliance, blindsiding Chris.\n\nAfter Tribal Council, Zeke attempted to realign with Chris's allies, Bret LaBelle and Sunday Burquest. The next day Bret informed Zeke that David was targeting him. During the reward trip, Bret came out to Zeke. After the Immunity Challenge, Zeke, Bret, Sunday, Jay Starrett, and Will Wahl agreed to target David. Zeke tried to get Hannah on board, but her indecisiveness made him believe that she was not with him. He then changed the target to her. At Tribal Council, there was a 5-5 tie vote between Zeke and Hannah. The revote still resulted in a tie, thus a rock drawing Tiebreaker occurred where Jessica was eliminated by picking the wrong rock.\n\nZeke's alliance was now in the majority. The next day, Zeke met his father, Sam, at the Loved Ones Challenge. After Adam won immunity, Zeke noticed how calm David was and suspected that he had a Hidden Immunity Idol. He changed the target to David's ally, Ken McNickle. However, after Ken revealed to Zeke and his allies Will was trying to get Zeke out, they tried to convince him to stay, and switched the target to Hannah. At Tribal Council, Will flipped and Adam played his idol on Hannah, sending Zeke to the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Zeke did not believe Ken contributed to or evolved the game, so he asked Hannah and Adam what they did. He voted for Adam to win, which he did in a unanimous 10-0-0 vote.	9	0	9	7	8	3.33	33	0.27

11	Zeke Smith	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Zeke_Smith	2	Zeke started on Nuku. Nuku won the first two challenges. He along with Cirie Fields, Andrea Boehlke, Ozzy Lusth, and Sarah Lacina were switched to Tavua after the tribe switch occurred. They were joined by Mana member Troyzan Robertson. Tavua dominated the next three challenges.\n\nZeke, Andrea, Sarah, and Ozzy were switched back to Nuku after the second tribe switch. They were joined by original Nuku Tai Trang and original Manas Jeff Varner and Sandra Diaz-Twine. Zeke wanted Sandra out, but he lied to Jeff that he wanted Tai out to avoid Sandra and Jeff to scramble. Nuku lost immunity on Day 16. At Tribal Council, Zeke, Tai, Andrea, Sarah, and Ozzy voted for Sandra thus sending her out.\n\nThe next day, Jeff began making his moves against Ozzy, recruiting both Sarah and Zeke. Zeke apologized for leaving Jeff out of the Sandra vote and promised to be honest with him moving forward, with plans of reaching the Final Tribal Council together. Nuku lost immunity on Day 18. At camp, Jeff tried to convince Zeke again to get rid of Ozzy, but Zeke was conflicted due to his strategy of keeping larger targets in the game as shields. Zeke's hesitance caused Jeff to believe that Zeke and Ozzy had a secret alliance.\n\nAt Tribal Council, a desperate Jeff outed Zeke as a transgender man, and tried to insinuate that Zeke's hiding this aspect of his life showed an ability to be deceitful. However, everyone else—including host Jeff Probst—quickly and emphatically rebuked Varner for this tactic. After a long discussion, Varner apologized, and expressed shame and remorse for what he had done. Seeing that Varner's actions would clearly lead to his elimination, Probst took an open roll call from all of the players, and then eliminated Varner without a formal vote.\n\nZeke reached the merge. At the feast, he revealed he is transgender. While Michaela Bradshaw was the original target, Zeke and Cirie managed to turn the vote on Hali Ford, so she was eliminated at the merged Tribal Council though he received two votes. Zeke then decided to target Cirie and Andrea. During the reward trip on Day 22, Zeke talked to Debbie Wanner and Tai about targeting Cirie and Andrea but Debbie was skeptical. After the Immunity Challenge, Zeke told Sierra Dawn Thomas Cirie, Andrea, and Aubry Bracco want to vote her out and he wants to target Andrea. However, Sierra told this to Cirie. Cirie told Andrea, and then both of them targeted Zeke. However, Debbie convinced Sierra to spare Zeke and blindside Ozzy. At Tribal Council, Zeke voted for Aubry, received four votes, and Ozzy was blindsided as the Power Six alliance, which now included Sarah, voted against him.\n\nAfter Tribal Council, Andrea called him shady. Sarah later talked to Zeke about working together. Troyzan won immunity. At camp, Sarah talked to Zeke about overthrowing the new majority alliance. At Tribal Council, Zeke and Sarah flipped to blindside Debbie.\n\nAndrea, Aubry, Brad Culpepper, Sarah, and Zeke won the next Reward Challenge. On the reward, Brad and Zeke bonded, which made the others suspicious, especially an already-wary Andrea. Zeke later made a long-term alliance with Brad and Troyzan. Andrea won immunity. At camp, Andrea plotted to eliminate Zeke though Sarah and Michaela wanted to keep him. However, at Tribal Council, Sarah and Michaela flipped on Zeke, blindsiding him in a 5-3-2 vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Zeke praised Sarah's dominant strategic gameplay throughout the merge and told her he was her champion. Zeke ultimately voted for Sarah who won in a 7-3-0 vote over Brad and Troyzan.	10	0	10	7	8	2.27	29	0.34
7	Jeff Varner	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jeff_Varner	3	Jeff started his third season on the Mana tribe. When Mana lost the first two Immunity Challenges, he joined the majority in voting out Ciera Eastin and Tony Vlachos respectively. He, along with Sandra Diaz-Twine, Malcolm Freberg, Aubry Bracco, and Michaela Bradshaw, were switched to Nuku after the first tribe switch. They joined Nuku member J.T. Thomas. Jeff faced a heavy blow on Night 11 when Malcolm was blindsided. On Day 13, he was caught in the middle between the duo of J.T. & Aubry who targeted Michaela and Michaela & Sandra who targeted J.T.. He chose to side with the latter duo to avenge Malcolm, hence blindsiding J.T..\n\nJeff and Sandra remained on Nuku after the second tribe switch, but were joined by original Nuku members Sarah Lacina, Andrea Boehlke, Zeke Smith, Ozzy Lusth, and Tai Trang, leaving Jeff and Sandra on the bottom. Zeke led the original Nuku alliance into claiming that they were against Tai in order to keep Jeff and Sandra from scrambling, allowing them to take the latter out. When Nuku lost, Jeff was confident that Tai was going home. However, when Tai accidentally told him Sandra was the target, Jeff became suspicious. Though Jeff and Sandra stuck together in voting for Tai, the Nuku alliance succeeded in voting out Sandra, leaving Jeff as the odd man out.\n\nAfter Tribal Council, Jeff planned on trying to convince everyone to get rid of Ozzy for being a physical threat come the merge. The next day, Jeff began making his moves against Ozzy, recruiting both Sarah and Zeke. Zeke apologized for leaving Jeff out of the Sandra vote and promised to be honest with him moving forward, with plans of reaching the Final Tribal Council together. When Nuku lost immunity again, Jeff tried to convince Zeke again to get rid of Ozzy, but Zeke was conflicted due to his strategy of keeping larger targets in the game as shields. Zeke's hesitance caused Jeff to believe that Zeke and Ozzy had a secret alliance, which he exposed to the other tribe members, causing them to question their loyalties.\n\nAt Tribal Council, a desperate Jeff outed Zeke as a transgender man, and tried to insinuate that Zeke's hiding this aspect of his life showed an ability to be deceitful. However, everyone else—including host Jeff Probst—quickly and emphatically rebuked Jeff for this tactic. After a long discussion, Jeff apologized, expressing shame and remorse for what he had done. Seeing that Jeff's actions would clearly lead to his elimination, Probst took an open roll call from all of the players, then had Varner eliminated without a formal vote.\n\nIt was revealed that Jeff was fired from his job as a real estate agent after the episode where he outed Zeke aired because of all the controversy. However, at the Reunion Show, he revealed to have gotten hired by another real estate agency. He also revealed that he has been working on a book called "Surviving Shame".	4	0	14	3	5	3	18	0.22
6	Sandra Diaz-Twine	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sandra_Diaz-Twine	5	Sandra entered Survivor: Game Changers as one of three former winners, but had an especially big target on her back being the first two-time winner. She was initially placed on the Mana tribe. After Mana lost the first Immunity Challenge on Day 3, the tribe made an easy vote and decided to unanimously vote Ciera Eastin out for playing too hard too early. The next day, Sandra made an alliance with fellow former winner Tony Vlachos on the basis that they were both major threats, with the duo planning to link up with J.T. Thomas, the third winner in the season, should they ever meet on the same tribe. Sandra and Tony pulled in Aubry Bracco, Caleb Reynolds, and Malcolm Freberg, and thus the alliance of five controlled the nine-person Mana tribe. However, on Night 5, Tony caught Sandra talking with Troyzan Robertson in the middle of the night. Even though Sandra had not reneged on the alliance, Tony misinterpreted the conversation and confronted her. This resulted in Sandra and Tony turning against each other — Tony for seeing Sandra as too major a threat, and Sandra for not wanting to be controlled by another person. Mana narrowly lost their second challenge on Day 6. Sandra gathered her troops; she spoke to those who were on the outs of the alliance of big threats, namely Troyzan, Hali Ford, Jeff Varner, and Michaela Bradshaw, wanting them to vote with her to take out Tony. At Tribal Council, Sandra voted against Aubry in the event that Tony played a Hidden Immunity Idol while the rest of the tribe voted in her favor and sent Tony packing.\n\nDay 7 brought a Tribe Switch, with Sandra being sent to the Nuku tribe with her former Mana tribemates Aubry, Jeff, Malcolm, and Michaela, leaving J.T., the sole original Nuku, on the outs. Nuku won the third Immunity Challenge, and later the first Reward Challenge. During this time, J.T. plotted with Malcolm to take Sandra out of the competition behind her back. At the Immunity Challenge on Day 11, host Jeff Probst revealed that only one tribe would win immunity and that the two tribes who lost the challenge would be sent to a Joint Tribal Council, where they would collectively vote one person out. Nuku had an early lead but the tribe would narrowly lose the challenge to the Tavua tribe, sending to Tribal Council with Mana. That afternoon, J.T. continued plotting against Sandra, mainly with his new ally Malcolm. However, the rest of the tribe planned to vote together. They planned to vote against Mana's Sierra Dawn Thomas for being their strongest female competitor. At a chaotic Tribal Council, J.T. revealed to his original Nuku tribemates on Mana that Sierra was Nuku's target, and hoped to get the Mana tribe to blindside Sandra. In the end, Nuku continued with their original plan, piling their votes onto Sierra. Unfortunately, Tai Trang played his idol on Sierra, negating the six votes cast against her. Malcolm was taken out, much to the chagrin of the Nuku tribe.\n\nMalcolm's untimely blindside infuriated Sandra, who, after the Tribal Council, confronted J.T. Sandra planned to get J.T. out for his "dirty deed" should Nuku lose the next Immunity Challenge. After Nuku won the challenge, Sandra played on the brewing feud between J.T. and Michaela, escalating the tension by consuming the tribe's sugar and putting the blame on Michaela. Nuku went on to lose the Immunity Challenge, with Sandra seizing the opportunity to exact revenge on J.T. At Tribal Council, J.T. and Michaela's feud reached a fever pitch. Sandra took advantage of this to secure Michaela's vote. She pulled the wool over Aubry and J.T., and with Jeff's vote, J.T. was sent home with an idol in his pocket.\n\nA second Tribe Switch occurred on Day 14, placing Sandra on the third revision of the Nuku tribe. She was relegated to the bottom with Jeff, as the original Nuku members who were sent to Tavua in the first switch held the majority. The Tavua Alliance planned to get Sandra out for being a two-time winner. Sandra's fate was sealed when Nuku lost the next Immunity Challenge. However, she saw through the majority's lie that she was safe over Tai and tried to gather votes against him by telling Andrea Boehlke, Ozzy Lusth, and Sarah Lacina that she would vote with them come the merge. At Tribal Council, Tai whispered to Sandra, telling her to vote against Ozzy. Sandra made a last-ditch attempt to gather votes against Ozzy or against Tai for his perceived duplicity, but this was all for naught. Sandra was voted out in a 5-2 vote. However, she received a positive ovation from her tribemates when leaving and also emerged as the highest-placing former winner in the season.	3	0	15	8	7	3.5	16	0.19
4	Malcolm Freberg	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Malcolm_Freberg	3	Malcolm started off on the Mana tribe. After losing the first Immunity Challenge of the season, he joined the rest of his tribe in voting Ciera Eastin off first. At the second Immunity Challenge, he helped Mana make a come from behind after they failed in the first stage of the challenge. However, he could not close the victory and thus Mana returned to Tribal Council. Malcolm had formed an alliance with Aubry Bracco, Caleb Reynolds, Sandra Diaz-Twine, and Tony Vlachos prior to the vote, but because of a feud breaking out between Sandra and Tony, Malcolm ultimately defected from the alliance and joined Sandra's side of the tribe in voting Tony out.\n\nAt the switch, Malcolm was switched to the new Nuku tribe, which had a 5-1 Mana majority, leaving J.T. on the outs. Malcolm was comfortable at Nuku camp, not only because of Mana's stronghold but also because of how much of an improvement it was from Mana's inferior camp. His tribe won the third Immunity Challenge, and for the first time in the season, Malcolm abstained from Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 10, Malcolm and J.T. won the Reward Challenge for Nuku, winning coffee, cookies, and chocolate for the tribe. The pair also started to form a bond, as J.T. discussed the idea of voting Sandra off the tribe for being a major threat. The following day, Nuku and Mana lost the Immunity Challenge, which sent them to a Joint Tribal Council. Before Tribal Council, Nuku discussed who they should target on Mana. However, J.T. remained intent on voting out Sandra.\n\nAt a chaotic Tribal Council, J.T. spilled the beans to Mana, telling them that Sierra Dawn Thomas was Nuku's target. After the votes were cast, Tai Trang capitalized on this leak, and played his Hidden Immunity Idol on Sierra. The 6 votes cast by Nuku against Sierra were negated, and Malcolm - Mana's target - received a kiss from Sierra as he was blindsided and voted off 5-0 for being a challenge threat, shocking his tribemates.	2	0	17	8	7	2.5	11	0.18
2	Tony Vlachos	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tony_Vlachos	3	Tony entered Survivor: Game Changers as one of the season's three former winners, along with J.T. Thomas and Sandra Diaz-Twine. He was initially placed on the Mana tribe. Minutes after arriving at camp, Tony jokingly ran off making llama sounds, blatantly proclaiming that he was on a hunt for a Hidden Immunity Idol. Though it started as a joke, after he realized that no one was on his tail, Tony decided to start digging a "spy bunker" in the sand near the water well in order to eavesdrop on conversations. Ultimately, he was caught by Sandra and Caleb Reynolds and had to put his spy bunker on hold.\n\nAfter Mana lost the first Immunity Challenge, Tony gathered the tribe members who were at the water well and the group decided to boot Ciera Eastin first for her over-scheming and for her failure in the challenge. When Ciera approached the group, Tony threw out Michaela Bradshaw's name, and Ciera accepted this as the plan for the night. However, when Tony told Michaela that it was her that was being used as a decoy, Michaela became upset. The majority decided that it might be a good idea to take out Michaela, who was not only emotionally volatile, but also an unknown factor. In the end, Mana stuck to their original plan, and Ciera was voted out unanimously.\n\nImmediately after Tribal Council, Tony felt uneasy that the first vote had gone so easily. He wanted to start playing hard, and so went back to the water well and continued to dig his bunker. The next day, Tony approached Aubry Bracco and the two decided that it may be best if they recruit other big threats in order to use them as shields and as allies. They decided to bring in Caleb, Sandra, and Malcolm Freberg. However, in the middle of the night, Sandra and Troyzan Robertson went to the well in order to discuss tribal happenings. Tony had been working on his bunker, and so he crawled into the bushes, and later jumped out at the pair after he heard his name being thrown out. He decided that Sandra was too sketchy, and effectively cut her loose from the "big threats alliance". In response, Sandra began recruiting for her own alliance, and brought in Michaela, Troyzan, Hali Ford, and Jeff Varner after being left out of Tony's alliance.\n\nAfter Mana narrowly lost the second Immunity Challenge, Tony and Sandra campaigned against each other. The two winners gathered their troops, and Jeff and Michaela became the two swing votes. At Tribal Council, the tribe discussed how physical strength should be kept in the tribe to prevent further losses. Sandra was rattled, and when Tony continued to campaign against her, she countered with reasons to take Tony out. When it was time to vote, Tony voted against Aubry, in the hopes that a split vote may have been in operation and that by voting against his ally, he could save himself. However, the only other person who had voted for Aubry was Sandra, and the rest of the tribe eliminated Tony. Before departing, Tony called out Sandra for her control of the tribe, to which Sandra retaliated by saying that Tony had targeted her first.	0	0	19	8	7	6	6	0.00
1	Ciera Eastin	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ciera_Eastin	3	Ciera was placed on the Mana tribe. Early on in the game, she began to play hard and told some of her other tribemates that she wanted to break the bond between Caleb Reynolds and Tony Vlachos by splitting votes, which did not sit well with the tribe. After losing the first Immunity Challenge of the season, one that she had previously competed in, the target on her back became larger. While the tribe planned to vote her off, she was told that the target for the night was Michaela Bradshaw. Satisfied that the target was not on her, she decided to go along with the plan. Later that day, Michaela was upset that her name had been thrown out as a decoy, and the tribe contemplated taking out Michaela instead of Ciera. Ultimately, the tribe decided it was best to keep challenge strength and tribal unity, and thus Ciera was voted off unanimously, becoming the first casualty of the season.	0	0	20	6	7	3	3	0.00
20	Sarah Lacina	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sarah_Lacina	3	Sarah was initially placed on the Nuku tribe, where she aligned with Cirie Fields. However, many other Nuku members were targeting Cirie and Sarah and were willing to go along with that plan if they lost. However, because Nuku won the first two challenges, they did not go to Tribal Council. After a Tribe Switch on Day 7, she, along with fellow Nuku members Cirie, Andrea Boehlke, Ozzy Lusth and Zeke Smith, along with original Mana member Troyzan Robertson, was switched to the newly formed third tribe, Tavua. There, Sarah aligned with outsider Troyzan, but Tavua did not go to Tribal Council due to strong performances at the next three Immunity Challenges.\n\nAfter Tavua was dissolved at a second switch on Day 14, she, along with Andrea, Ozzy, Zeke, and Tai Trang, was switched back to Nuku, where they were joined by Jeff Varner and Sandra Diaz-Twine. After Nuku lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 16, Sarah voted with the majority at Tribal Council, resulting in Sandra's elimination and Debbie Wanner joining the tribe after returning from Exile Island. After Nuku lost immunity again on Day 18, Jeff outed Zeke for being transgender at the subsequent Tribal Council, hoping to paint him as being capable of deception. Sarah tearfully accused Jeff of making a malicious attack, and expressed her support for Zeke. She then joined the rest of the tribe in verbally voting out Jeff.\n\nOnce the tribes merged into the Maku Maku tribe on Day 19, Sarah joined the Tavua Alliance led by Andrea and Cirie. However, she also formed strong bonds with the rival Power Six alliance, led by Brad Culpepper and Sierra Dawn Thomas, and joined them to eliminate Hali Ford at the first post-merge Tribal Council. On Day 24, Sarah found herself the swing vote between the two alliances. Andrea and Cirie wanted to vote out Zeke for betraying the Tavua Alliance, while Debbie attempted to recruit Sarah to join the Power Six to eliminate challenge threat Ozzy. At Tribal Council, Sarah joined the Power Six to blindside Ozzy with the added insurance of Debbie's Extra Vote.\n\nOn Day 25, Sarah managed to retrieve the Vote Steal advantage, which was placed under the sit-out bench at a Reward Challenge. Although Sarah competed in the challenge, she noticed the advantage while Michaela Bradshaw, who was sitting out, did not. Before boarding the boat to leave the challenge, Sarah managed to grab the advantage without her tribemates noticing. After the next Immunity Challenge, the Power Six targeted Andrea, though Sarah felt excluded from the decision and conspired with Zeke. However, Sarah reconsidered after Sierra proposed a final three deal with her and Debbie. Later, Debbie told Aubry Bracco that Sarah did not trust her. Aubry informed Sarah and the rest of her alliance of this, which made Sarah flip to the Tavua Alliance to blindside Debbie.\n\nSarah later revealed her Vote Steal advantage to Cirie in order to secure her trust. After Andrea won the next Immunity Challenge, she campaigned to eliminate Zeke for continuously plotting against the Tavua Alliance. This worried Sarah and Michaela, as they were afraid that this would allow the remnants of the Power Six to later regain the majority. However, both Sarah and Michaela joined their alliance in blindsiding Zeke at Tribal Council. The following day, Sarah tearfully reunited with her husband, Wyatt, at the Loved Ones Challenge. Though the team of Aubry, Andrea, and Brad won, Sarah and Cirie were chosen to join them on the reward, along with their loved ones. Following this, Sierra told Sarah about the Legacy Advantage she acquired at the marooning, stating that if she were to be voted out, she would will the advantage to her. As a result of this information, Sarah orchestrated Sierra's elimination, feigning expressions of shock after the votes were read. Unaware that Sarah had participated in her blindside, Sierra willed Sarah the Legacy Advantage, which appeared in her bag the following morning.\n\nPrior to Tribal Council on Day 35, Sarah gave her Vote Steal advantage to Cirie as a sign of trust and just wanted Cirie to "hold on to" the advantage as a favor. In order to save Sarah from Tai's plan to eliminate her, Cirie tried to play the advantage at Tribal Council. However, it was then revealed that the advantage was non-transferable, and could only be played by the person who found it. Sarah asked for the advantage back and subsequently played it, negating Tai's vote and putting two votes on Michaela, one of Cirie's closest allies. Brad and Troyzan voted for Michaela as well, resulting in her elimination. After returning from Tribal Council, Sarah confronted Cirie for attempting to use the advantage without discussing her plan beforehand, and Cirie told her that she did so only because Sarah did not believe that Tai was coming after her. After finding out from Tai himself about his plan to vote her out, Sarah apologized to Cirie and rebuked Tai for backstabbing her.\n\nThe following day, Brad won immunity and chose to share the reward with Sarah and Troyzan. On the reward, the three agreed to target Tai. At Tribal Council, Sarah played the Legacy Advantage, which negated the three votes cast against her, Tai played a Hidden Immunity Idol on himself and Aubry, and Troyzan played an idol on himself, leaving Cirie as the only non-immune person, causing her to be eliminated by default. On Day 37, Sarah and Tai were caught in the middle of the duo of Brad and Troyzan who were targeting Aubry, and Aubry who was targeting Troyzan. Both Sarah and Tai ended up siding with Brad and Troyzan, leading to Aubry's unanimous elimination. On Day 38, Brad and Troyzan targeted Tai, while Tai targeted Troyzan, leaving Sarah as the swing vote. Tai tried to persuade Sarah to force a tie and allow him to compete against Troyzan in a fire-making challenge, but Sarah ultimately sided with Brad and Troyzan and Tai was unanimously voted out.\n\nSarah received a mixed reception at the Final Tribal Council. She was lauded for her strategic control and social flexibility, but condemned for using social relationships for strategic gain and her numerous betrayals. Sarah's strategic control throughout the post-merge phase beat out Brad's dominance in Immunity Challenges and Troyzan's lack of evident gameplay and she was awarded the title of Sole Survivor in a 7-3-0 vote.	9	1	1	7	9	3.21	39	0.23
17	Tai Trang	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tai_Trang	2	Tai started on Nuku, which won the first two challenges. He was switched to Mana after the tribe switch, where he was reunited with friend and former Kaôh Rōng ally Caleb Reynolds. After losing the Immunity Challenge on Day 9, Caleb was a target for his bond with Tai and being an outsider on a tribe dominated by original Nuku members. While Tai wanted to vote out the other outsider Hali Ford, Brad Culpepper convinced him to vote out Caleb. Tai joined the majority in voting out Caleb at Tribal Council. Tavua won the next Immunity Challenge on Day 11. After the challenge, host Jeff Probst revealed that the losing Mana and Nuku tribes had to go to a Joint Tribal Council and vote out one member. Tai managed to find a Hidden Immunity Idol minutes before Tribal Council and told all his tribemates, minus Hali. At Tribal Council, Brad convinced him to play the idol on Sierra Dawn Thomas. The votes against her were negated and Mana's votes sent Malcolm Freberg out of the game. Before the next tribe switch on Day 14, Tai found the re-hidden Mana idol.\n\nTai was switched back to Nuku after the second tribe switch, where he found a third idol, the re-hidden Nuku idol, using the same method that he used to find his second. After Nuku lost immunity on Day 16, Tai accidentally told outsider Jeff Varner that the plan was to vote out the other outsider Sandra Diaz-Twine. At Tribal Council, Tai tried to target Ozzy Lusth, but this made the others consider voting him out. Sandra and Jeff took advantage of this and attempted to convince the tribe to vote out Tai for his unpredictability. However, the original Nuku members stayed together and Sandra was voted out in a 5-2 vote. When Jeff outed Zeke Smith for being transgender at the next Tribal Council, Tai scolded him. Tai, along with the others, then verbally voted out Jeff.\n\nThe two tribes merged into the Maku Maku tribe on Day 19. At the feast, host Jeff Probst said that two people had to volunteer to sit out. Tai and Brad volunteered. Tai then joined the majority in voting out Hali at the merged Tribal Council. On Day 24, Tai beat Ozzy to win the Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council, Tai's alliance, the Power Six convinced Sarah Lacina to join them in blindsiding Ozzy. Tai's alliance, now with Sarah, had a 6 to 5 majority. However, Sarah flipped at the next Tribal Council and voted Debbie Wanner out, thus leaving Tai in the minority. At the next Tribal Council, the remaining members of the Power Six threw their three votes to Tai, but Zeke was blindsided.\n\nOn Day 30, Tai bonded with Michaela Bradshaw, and the two formed a pact with Sierra and Troyzan Robertson to align with Brad and target Andrea Boehlke. After Brad won the next Immunity Challenge, both sides attempted to court Tai and Michaela. Sarah informed the two about Sierra's Legacy Advantage, securing their votes and sending Sierra to the jury. After Andrea was blindsided on Day 33, Tai consoled Aubry Bracco for being left out of the plan. This concerned Cirie Fields, who noted that Tai's ability to emotionally connect with others could be threatening.\n\nOn Day 35, Tai discussed with Aubry about eliminating Sarah, but Aubry wanted him out. After Sarah gave her Vote Steal to Cirie as a sign of trust, Cirie attempted to use it at Tribal Council to steal Tai's vote to save Sarah and make a big move herself. After Sarah revealed that the advantage was non-transferable, Sarah stole Tai's vote. Tai received votes from Michaela and Aubry, but Michaela was blindsided. After Tribal Council, he was confronted by Sarah for targeting her. He denied it at first but soon confessed, and this angered her. The next day, Brad tried to aggressively force Tai into giving him one of his idols, with the intention of eliminating Tai with five players remaining. After Brad won the Immunity Challenge, Tai told Aubry about his idols and promised to play one on her that night to ensure her loyalty; the two teamed up with Cirie to counter the alliance of Sarah, Brad, and Troyzan on the reward. At Tribal Council, Tai played his idols on himself and Aubry, this prompted Sarah to play the Legacy Advantage she received from Sierra, and for Troyzan to play his own idol. Cirie was eliminated by default as all the others were immune.\n\nOn Day 37, Tai contemplated siding with Aubry and voting out Troyzan. At Tribal Council however, he and Sarah sided with Brad and Troyzan, and Aubry was unanimously voted out. After Brad won the Final Immunity Challenge, Tai was targeted by Brad and Troyzan for betraying their alliance. He tried to convince Sarah to force a tie between him and Troyzan, but at Tribal Council, Tai was unanimously voted out.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Tai said in a confusing way that he believed his relationship with Sarah was real which caused the other jurors to laugh, and he chastised Brad for his condescending attitude. He ultimately voted for Sarah who won in a 7-3-0 vote over Brad and Troyzan.\n\nAt the Reunion Show, Brad apologized to Tai for the way he treated him, Probst polled the jury on who they would have voted for if Tai was in the Final Three instead of Sarah, and the result ended in a 5-5 tie between Tai and Brad; Probst then revealed if that happened the rules stated that the finalist out of the running which would have been Troyzan would become the final juror and select the winner, and Troyzan stated he would have vote for Brad, so it appeared that Tai would have finished second to Brad.	8	3	4	7	8	2.21	38	0.21
12	Sierra Dawn Thomas	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sierra_Dawn_Thomas	2	Sierra returned on Survivor: Game Changers and was placed on the Nuku tribe. During the opening scramble at the marooning on Day 1, Sierra found the Legacy Advantage hidden on the boat. She aligned with Brad Culpepper and found out that the advantage would give her immunity at the final 13 or final 6. On Day 7, Sierra, along with fellow Nukus Brad, Tai Trang, and Debbie Wanner were switched to Mana, where they were joined by original Mana members Caleb Reynolds and Sierra's fellow Worlds Apart castmate Hali Ford. After Mana lost the next Immunity Challenge, Sierra, Brad, Debbie, and Hali agreed to vote out Caleb, and he was voted out unanimously at Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 11, host Jeff Probst surprised the tribes when he announced that the two tribes that lost the Immunity Challenge would go to Tribal Council; both Mana and Nuku lost the subsequent challenge and had to go to a Joint Tribal Council, and vote out one castaway. Sierra made the suggestion of voting out Nuku's Malcolm Freberg, largely for his strength in challenges. At Tribal Council, Brad convinced Tai to give his Hidden Immunity Idol to Sierra, which she then played, after being told by Nuku member J.T. Thomas that she was the target. The six votes cast against her were negated, and Malcolm was blindsided. Sierra, along with Brad and Hali, remained on Mana after a second tribe switch on Day 14, with the tribe going on to win the next two Immunity Challenges.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Maku Maku tribe on Day 19, Sierra wanted Michaela Bradshaw out because she was growing annoyed by her personality. She later thought about splitting the vote between Hali and Michaela because she believed that Hali had an idol, with Hali being blindsided at the next Tribal Council. After being notified by Zeke Smith that she was the target, and that he wanted to work with her, she talked to Cirie Fields. She was later persuaded by Debbie to vote against Ozzy Lusth, and he was blindsided at the next Tribal Council. On Day 26, she told Sarah Lacina, whom she believed was on her side, that she wanted to make a Final Three deal with her and Debbie. However, Sarah flipped on Sierra's alliance, blindsiding Debbie, and leaving Sierra and her remaining Power Six allies on the bottom.\n\nAt the next Tribal Council, Sierra and her allies Brad and Troyzan Robertson were left out of the loop and voted for their own ally, Tai, in an effort to save themselves, though Zeke was blindsided by the Tavua Alliance. The next day, she told Sarah about her Legacy Advantage, and that she would will it to Sarah if she was voted out. Later that day, she was able to meet her dad, Danny, at the Family Visit, though her team lost the subsequent Reward Challenge. While Brad, Cirie, Sarah, Andrea Boehlke, and Aubry Bracco were on the reward trip with their loved ones, Michaela and Tai plotted with Sierra and Troyzan to align with Brad and target Andrea. After Brad won the next Immunity Challenge, Sierra and her alliance planned to convince Michaela and Tai to blindside Andrea. However, Sarah told Michaela and Tai about Sierra's Legacy Advantage, and this prompted them not to side with Sierra. At Tribal Council, Sierra, Brad, and Troyzan voted for Andrea, but the majority voted for Sierra, thus voting her out. Not knowing that Sarah was the reason for her elimination, Sierra willed the Legacy Advantage to her.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Sierra gave her vote to her ally Brad, who lost to Sarah in a 7-3-0 vote.	8	2	9	7	6	1.92	32	0.25
10	Debbie Wanner	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Debbie_Wanner	2	Despite being more known for her personality than her strategic gameplay, Debbie planned on playing aggressively out of the gate. She had no qualms with pretending to be Cirie Fields' ally although in reality, Debbie was one of many Nuku members prepared to vote Cirie out first had Nuku lost a challenge. Before that happened, Debbie swapped into the Mana tribe along with original tribe members Tai, Sierra, and Brad. Handed a tribal majority of 4-2, Debbie stuck with her original tribe as opposed to a potential Kaôh Rōng alliance with herself, Tai Trang, and Caleb Reynolds. After voting out Caleb, Debbie once again feigned loyalty to the outsider, Hali Ford, with the intent of voting her out later. That plan would be delayed when Jeff Probst announced that Mana and Nuku tribes would vote out a single person from either tribe. Debbie's tribe succeeded in that Tribal Council thanks to Tai's Hidden Immunity Idol. After Debbie's poor performance in the following Reward Challenge, she had a breakdown and lashed out at Hali and Brad Culpepper, but more so towards the latter. This caused the rest of the tribe to be concerned with her and put Debbie in danger. Despite Debbie's rage reappearing briefly, Mana won their first Immunity Challenge as a tribe on Day 13.\n\nThe second swap initially seemed like a bad draw for Debbie as drew the package that had no buff and was subsequently sent to Exile Island. However, not only was Exile Island on a boat filled with food, but Debbie was also visited by fomer two-time castaway and Survivor: Caramoan winner John Cochran, who gave her an opportunity to talk strategy, as well as an Advantage Menu between a fake Hidden Immunity Idol Kit, an Extra Vote, and a challenge advantage for her tribe at the next Immunity Challenge. She selected the Extra Vote due to it being the most certain of the three advantages. Debbie observed the Nuku Tribal Council and joined the tribe once Sandra Diaz-Twine left. Despite her absence, Debbie immediately joined the Nuku majority that had a sole Mana target in Jeff Varner. When Varner outed Zeke Smith as transgender, Debbie adamantly supported Zeke and scolded Varner, and joined the Nuku tribe in unanimously voting Varner out.\n\nDebbie began the merged portion in the game by playing up her kooky persona in the rewards so no one would target her. All the while, she mended relationships such as with Brad in order to solidify a majority alliance. Debbie orchestrated perhaps her biggest move of the game on Day 24 when Sierra Dawn Thomas informed her that Zeke was the easy target. Debbie brought up the idea of blindsiding Ozzy Lusth, the biggest challenge threat left in the game. With only the certainty of five of her allies, she decided to use her extra vote advantage. Although technically not necessary due to Cirie and Zeke's stray votes and Sarah Lacina siding with Debbie's alliance, the advantage use sealed Ozzy's fate. After having successfully pulled that move off, Debbie became the outspoken and upfront leader of the majority and got cocky. After Troyzan Robertson won immunity on Day 26, Debbie was certain her alliance would succeed in eliminating Andrea Boehlke. However, Sarah and members of the minority alliance started to become frustrated and annoyed with Debbie, and began formulating a plot against Debbie. Despite Sierra promising Sarah a final 3 with themselves and Debbie, Sarah joined Andrea and Cirie's alliance in voting out Debbie 6-5.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Debbie declared her intention in campaigning for Brad's victory, and she told Sarah she had no respect for her game because she was willing to win at all costs. She cast her vote for Brad which helped him finish 2nd as Sarah received 7 votes and became Sole Survivor.	8	0	11	7	8	3.2	26	0.31
9	Ozzy Lusth	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ozzy_Lusth	4	Ozzy started on Nuku, where his water skills helped his tribe win a toolkit in the marooning. Ozzy and JT discussed the possibility of voting out Cirie, claiming it was not because of a grudge from Micronesia but to keep the tribe strong. Nuku won the first two Immunity Challenges, keeping plans on hold and Nuku in tact going into the swap. He was switched to the Tavua tribe (third tribe) along with fellow Nuku members Cirie, Sarah, Andrea, and Zeke, along with Mana member Troyzan. Tavua dominated the next three challenges, only losing a Reward Challenge though Ozzy himself performed well. During this time with no Tribal Council visits, Ozzy once again became the tribe's provider, citing fishing as a meditation to keep his head in the game as well as strengthen his position in the tribe. He, along with Sarah, Andrea, and Zeke, were switched back to Nuku after the second tribe switch. Nuku lost immunity on Day 16, meaning this would be Ozzy's first Tribal Council of the season. Original Mana members Sandra and Varner appeared to be in a 5-2 minority, but Sandra approached Ozzy, Sarah, and Andrea with a plan to take out Tai to prevent a Kaôh Rōng core alliance forming at the merge with Debbie and Aubry still in the game. Ozzy admitted he was almost convinced, further solidifying how dangerous Sandra is as a player. At Tribal Council, Ozzy joined the majority in voting out Sandra Diaz-Twine for the first time in her Survivor career. Nuku lost immunity again on Day 18. Ozzy was targeted by Varner when the latter found out Zeke was playing him and aligned with Ozzy. However, the plan failed miserably when Jeff outed Zeke for being transgender during Tribal Council, appalling Ozzy and the rest of the tribe. Ozzy told Jeff he should be ashamed of himself. Ozzy contributed to Jeff's verbal unanimous elimination.\n\nOzzy reached the merge, making him the first and currently only player in Survivor history to make it to the merge four times. At the merged Tribal Council, Ozzy aided his alliance in eliminating Hali Ford. At the second Immunity Challenge which he won in Cook Islands, it came down to him and Tai Trang, but Ozzy ultimately lost to Tai. Though the initial targets were either Zeke or Andrea, Debbie Wanner campaigned for Ozzy's elimination. At Tribal Council, he voted for Zeke, but the Power Six alliance voted for him and Debbie used her Extra Vote Advantage to throw another vote on Ozzy, so he was blindsided. He came in 12th place and was the second member of the jury\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, he criticized Sarah's deceitful game-play and lauded Brad Culpepper for dominating in Immunity Challenges and playing a straight-up game, and even told Brad he was his champion. Debbie agreed with Ozzy's position and aided in this campaign, both of them going as far as laughing when Sarah said that the friendships she made in the game were genuine. He ended up casting his vote for Brad to win, but he lost to Sarah in a 7-3-0 vote.	9	0	12	6	7	0.89	24	0.38
3	Caleb Reynolds	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Caleb_Reynolds	2	Caleb started the game on the Mana tribe, where he immediately aligned with Tony Vlachos. This alliance prompted Ciera Eastin to target him in an attempt to flush any possible Hidden Immunity Idol Tony may have, but this idea backfired and made Ciera a target instead. After Mana lost the first Immunity Challenge on Day 3, Caleb joined the majority in voting out Ciera. Over the next few days, Tony and Sandra Diaz-Twine targeted each other, dividing the tribe in the process. When Mana again lost immunity, Caleb argued that Tony should stay because he can help the tribe win challenges, but at Tribal Council, Caleb joined the majority in voting out Tony.\n\nAt the Tribe Switch on Day 7, Caleb and Hali Ford were the original members to remain on Mana, where they were outnumbered by original Nuku members Brad Culpepper, Sierra Dawn Thomas, and Caleb's fellow Kaôh Rōng castmates Debbie Wanner and Tai Trang, with whom Caleb tried to reconnect. When Mana lost the next Immunity Challenge, Caleb and Hali were targeted for being the outsiders. While Tai wanted to keep Caleb, Brad convinced him that keeping Caleb was dangerous because it would make the others believe that they were a pair due to their previous relationship, which would put a huge target on Tai. At Tribal Council, Caleb voted against Hali, but found himself voted out in a 5-1 vote.	0	0	18	7	6	2.33	9	0.00
19	Brad Culpepper	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Brad_Culpepper	2	Brad started the game on Nuku. He aligned with Sierra Dawn Thomas on Day 1. Nuku won the first two challenges. He was switched to Mana after the Tribe Switch occurred. After Mana lost immunity, Caleb Reynolds was the target for being an outsider and his relationship with Tai Trang. Brad convinced Tai that it would be in his best interest to vote out Caleb. Caleb was unanimously voted out. Tavua won immunity on Day 11. However, the losing tribes (Nuku and Mana) had to go to a Joint Tribal Council, and vote out one member. At Tribal Council, J.T. Thomas told him that Sierra was the target. Then Brad convinced Tai to play his Hidden Immunity Idol on Sierra which resulted in Malcolm Freberg's elimination. After Mana lost the next Reward Challenge, Brad's tribemate Debbie Wanner called Brad a dictator and lashed out at him.\n\nHe remained on Mana after the second tribe switch. He managed to pull in Troyzan Robertson into his alliance. Mana lost the Reward Challenge. At camp, Brad discussed his newfound empathy towards the experiences of his wife Monica, which later prompted Aubry Bracco and Cirie Fields to approach Brad about aligning.\n\nBrad made it to the merge. At the feast, Jeff said two people had to volunteer to sit out. Brad and Tai volunteered. While their tribemates feasted, Brad and Tai reconnected and affirmed their alliance, with Brad targeting Hali Ford and Michaela Bradshaw, outsiders from the third Mana tribe. Hali was blindsided at the merge Tribal Council. On Day 26, Brad's ally Sarah Lacina flipped and blindsided Debbie, thus leaving Brad in the minority.\n\nOn Day 30, Brad met Monica at the Loved Ones Challenge. Brad managed to win immunity. However, Sierra was voted out at Tribal Council. Despite losing immunity on Day 33, Brad was spared as the majority decided to target Andrea Boehlke. Andrea was blindsided at Tribal Council, though Brad received two votes. Brad managed to win the next Immunity Challenge. Brad, Troyzan, and Sarah managed to blindside Michaela at Tribal Council with the help of Sarah's Vote Steal Advantage.\n\nAfter the chaotic Tribal Council, Tai felt as if he had lost all his allies; in an attempt to regroup, he told Brad about his two Hidden Immunity Idols. Brad still felt betrayed after Tai eliminated Brad's closest ally, Sierra, and tried to strongarm Tai into giving him one of his Hidden Immunity Idols, with the intention of eliminating Tai at the final five. On Day 36, Brad won his third Immunity Challenge. He chose to share the reward with Sarah and Troyzan. During their feast, they conspired to split the votes between Aubry and Tai in case of Tai's Hidden Immunity Idols. Brad voted for Aubry at Tribal Council, but after a series of Hidden Immunity Idols and Sarah's Legacy Advantage were played, which caused Cirie the only non immune person left to get eliminated by default. \n\nBrad won his 4th Immunity Challenge on Day 37. Both Brad and Troyzan targeted Aubry. Aubry was unanimously voted out at Tribal Council. Brad won the Final Immunity Challenge which was also his 5th Immunity Challenge win. He believed he had won the game, and he wanted Tai out for constantly betraying him. Brad got his way as Tai was unanimously voted out.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Ozzy Lusth and Debbie commended Brad for his challenge dominance, and Ozzy told Brad he was his champion, but Michaela and Andrea questioned his lack of social game, Cirie told him she believed Sierra was the brains behind their alliance, and Tai criticized him for his condescending attitude. Brad received votes from Debbie, Ozzy, and Sierra which enabled him to become the runner-up. He defeated Troyzan who came in third place with zero votes, but lost to Sarah who won with seven votes.\n\nAt the Live Reunion Show, Brad apologized to Tai for the way he treated him, Jeff polled the jury on who they would have voted for if Tai was in the Final Three instead of Sarah, and the result ended in a 5-5 tie between Brad and Tai; Jeff then said if that happened the rules stated that the finalist out of the running which would be Troyzan would become the final juror and select the winner, and Troyzan stated he would have vote for Brad so it appeared that Brad would have won in that scenario.	15	0	2	7	8	2.21	39	0.38
18	Troyzan Robertson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Troyzan_Robertson	2	Troyzan started on the Mana Tribe. On Day 2, he caught Tony Vlachos working on his spy bunker and relayed this information to Malcolm Freberg. After Mana lost the first Immunity Challenge, Troyzan joined the majority in voting out Ciera Eastin at the first Tribal Council. The next night he talked to Sandra Diaz-Twine about voting out Tony. Tony overheard the conversation and confronted the two, but they both denied the accusation. Troyzan, Sandra, and Hali Ford convince the tribe to vote out Tony after losing the second Immunity Challenge.\n\nAt the Tribe switch, Troyzan is switched to Tavua. He was the only original Mana member on Tavua so he felt like an outsider. However, he managed to find a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol, and after winning the Immunity Challenge; he managed to find the idol while no one was looking. Tavua dominated the next few challenges. He was switched back to Mana after the second tribe switch. On Mana, he aligned with Brad Culpepper and joined his alliance.\n\nTroyzan, along with Aubry Bracco, Michaela Bradshaw, and Hali were the only original Mana members to make it to the merge. He won immunity on Day 25. However at Tribal Council, Sarah flipped on his alliance so his ally Debbie Wanner was blindsided. While he was now in the minority, he was not targeted. On Night 35, Troyzan, Brad, and Sarah successfully blindsided Michaela.\n\nOn Day 36, Brad won immunity and chose to share the reward with Sarah and Troyzan. On the reward, the three agreed to target Tai Trang. At Tribal Council, Tai played both of his idols on himself and Aubry respectively, then Sarah played her Legacy Advantage, and this prompted Troyzan to play his idol. Since Cirie was the only one that was not immune, she was eliminated by default. On Night 37, Troyzan received a vote from Aubry, but Aubry was unanimously voted out. On Day 38, Tai was unanimously voted out, but Troyzan received a voted from Tai. Troyzan made it to the end along with Sarah and Brad.\n\nTroyzan was mostly ignored during the Final Tribal Council, and the few times he was spoken to, he was accused of being a follower. However, he argued that he had personal relationships with everyone, and he made quiet moves. He ended up receiving zero jury votes. He lost to Brad who came in second place with three jury votes and Sarah who won with seven votes.	8	1	3	7	6	1	39	0.21
16	Aubry Bracco	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Aubry_Bracco	3	Returning for Game Changers, Aubry was initially placed on the Mana tribe. Mana would lose the first Immunity Challenge and vote out Ciera Eastin for her overzealous personality and eagerness to make big moves, though Aubry did (somewhat unsuccessfully) try to calm Michaela down when the latter was upset about being the decoy vote. Following Ciera's elimination, Aubry quickly joined forces with Tony Vlachos, Malcolm Freberg, Caleb Reynolds, and Sandra Diaz-Twine in hopes of forming an alliance out of players deemed obvious threats by the other castaways. That alliance did not even last one vote because Tony became paranoid of Sandra, believing she was plotting with Troyzan Robertson to blindside him. This paranoia would ultimately lead to Sandra doing just that and Tony was eliminated the subsequent Tribal Council and Aubry receiving votes as well. With Tony eliminated, Aubry found herself on the bottom but was saved by a Tribe Switch on Day 7. Aubry would join Malcolm, Sandra, Michaela Bradshaw, and Jeff Varner from Mana, and J.T. Thomas from Nuku to form the new Nuku tribe. While initially ostracized by Sandra and her allies, the tribe banded together on Night 11 when both the Nuku and Mana tribes had to attend Tribal Council together. With Nuku having six members over Mana's five, the vote seemed simple enough, but when J.T. warned his old tribe members of their plans to target Sierra Dawn Thomas, Tai Trang played a Hidden Immunity Idol on her, blindsiding Malcolm.\n\nFollowing Malcolm's blindside, Aubry attempted to persuade Sandra and Jeff to target Michaela for her negative attitude over J.T., but to no avail. After Nuku lost the next challenge, J.T. was eliminated and Aubry was left without an ally. Aubry would once again be spared from imminent elimination thanks to a second Tribe Switch and a subsequent spree of Immunity Challenge wins. During that immunity streak, Aubry was impressed with Brad Culpepper opening up after an emotional reward victory and expressed her desire to work with him. On Day 19, the tribes merged. Despite that previous bonding with Brad, Aubry quickly formed strong bonds with Andrea Boehlke and Zeke Smith. At the first Tribal Council of the merge, free agent Hali Ford was eliminated by Brad Culpepper and Sierra, who were seen as the two leaders of the tribe. Following the blindside of Ozzy Lusth, Aubry joined Cirie Fields, Michaela, and Sarah Lacina to form the new Maku Maku majority alliance tribe and attempted to take out Brad and Sierra's alliance.\n\nAfter orchestrating the elimination of fellow Kaôh Rōng castaway Debbie Wanner, Aubry managed to go somewhat under the radar thanks to bubbling conflict between Andrea and Zeke. After successfully winning her first Individual Immunity Challenge on Day 33, Aubry was suddenly cast out by her alliance when her closest ally Andrea was blindsided. Relegated back to the minority, Aubry managed to reconnect with former Kaôh Rōng ally Tai and was saved during the infamous Tribal Council on Night 36 when Tai played a Hidden Immunity Idol on both himself and Aubry. This relationship would prove to be short-lived as Tai would immediately thereafter align with Sarah against Aubry for fear of her being too well perceived by the jury. After failing to win immunity, Aubry was voted out in a 4-1 vote on Night 37. Aubry would place 5th overall and become the 9th member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Aubry, along with Ozzy and Cirie, questioned Troyzan about his lack of leadership and decision making. Ultimately, Aubry voted for her ally Sarah, contributing to her 7-3-0 victory over Brad.	0	0	5	8	7	1.43	37	0.00
15	Cirie Fields	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Cirie_Fields	4	Returning for Survivor: Game Changers, Cirie was initially placed on the Nuku tribe. On Day 1, she tried to make amends with Ozzy Lusth, who was still wary of her for her role in his blindside in Micronesia. Seeing that Ozzy and J.T. Thomas, another player Cirie had a history with from their time on Heroes vs. Villains, were getting close, Cirie attempted to recruit allies against them, approaching Debbie Wanner, Sarah Lacina, and Zeke Smith, who were all wary of aligning with the majority's target. While it appeared that she was on the outs, Cirie was spared when Nuku won the first two challenges.\n\nOn Day 7, a Tribe Switch split the two tribes into three, and Cirie was sent to the new Tavua tribe to start from scratch, along with original Nuku tribemates Andrea Boehlke, Ozzy, Sarah, and Zeke, as well as the only original Mana member, Troyzan Robertson. There, Cirie and Ozzy finally reconciled and agreed to target Troyzan. However, the tribe managed to win the next three Immunity Challenges, avoiding Tribal Council. On Day 14, a second Tribe Switch occurred, where Tavua was abolished and Cirie was switched to the Mana tribe. Although the depleted tribe suffered a setback when they lost a Reward Challenge for pizza on Day 17, the tribe rebounded, winning the last two tribal Immunity Challenges.\n\nAfter the tribes merged into the Maku Maku tribe on Day 19, Michaela Bradshaw, who was the main target, approached Cirie and told her that she wanted them to be the first pair of African-American women to make it to the end, and Cirie began mentoring her. With both alliances agreeing to split their votes between outsiders Michaela and Hali Ford, Cirie and Zeke began campaigning for Michaela to stay. At Tribal Council, her plan worked as Hali was voted out. The following day, Cirie and Andrea contemplate targeting Brad Culpepper and Sierra Dawn Thomas for taking charge of the previous night's vote. However, Zeke was not pleased by this, wanting to be the one to call the shots within the Tavua Alliance, and went to Sierra to propose targeting Andrea. After Tai Trang won the next Immunity Challenge, Sierra informed Cirie of Zeke's plan, and the Tavua Alliance swiftly targeted him. At Tribal Council, however, Sarah flipped on the alliance and Debbie used her Extra Vote to ensure Ozzy's elimination.\n\nOn Day 25, Cirie attempted to convince Sarah to turn on the Power Six alliance. When Troyzan won immunity, Sarah felt excluded from the decision-making within the Power Six and ended up flipping, blindsiding Debbie at Tribal Council. Although back in the majority, Cirie and Andrea still did not trust Zeke and discussed betraying him with Sarah, who objected to the plan. To secure Cirie's trust, Sarah told Cirie about her Vote Steal advantage. When Andrea won the next Immunity Challenge, she led the charge to take Zeke out. Still, Michaela and Sarah remained skeptical of the plan, fearing that this would give the remnants of the Power Six a chance to regain the majority. At Tribal Council, however, the two joined the rest of the Tavua Alliance in sending Zeke to the jury.\n\nThe next day, Cirie recruited Tai to the alliance after his allies turned on him the night before. The next day, the Loved Ones Challenge took place and Cirie's youngest son, Jared, showed up. The team of Andrea, Brad, and Aubry Bracco won the challenge and chose Cirie and Sarah, along with their loved ones, to accompany them on the barbecue. After Brad won immunity, the alliance voted Sierra out at Tribal Council. After Tribal Council, Cirie and Andrea were suspicious of Sarah's reaction after Sierra's elimination, not knowing that it was a ruse on Sarah's part to ensure that she was the recipient of Sierra's Legacy Advantage. When Aubry won immunity Day 33, she pushed the alliance to vote out Brad, though Andrea wanted to eliminate Sarah. Cirie, wanting to keep Sarah in the game as a bigger target than herself, talked to Sarah about betraying Andrea that night. Cirie's plan worked as Andrea was blindsided.\n\nBack at camp, Aubry, who was left out of the plan, was consoled by Tai. Cirie noted Tai's ability to emotionally connect with others, worrying that this could make him a threat. When Brad won immunity on Day 35, Tai told Aubry that he wanted to target Sarah, but Aubry relayed Tai's plan to Cirie, who later told Sarah. Sarah, skeptical about Tai's betrayal, gave Cirie her Vote Steal as a sign of trust right before Tribal Council, which Cirie promised to return to Sarah after that night as Sarah just wanted Cirie to "hold on to" the advantage as a favor. However, Cirie considered using it to save Sarah and eliminate Tai. At Tribal Council, Cirie, without having time to read the rules of the advantage, tried to use the vote stealer to steal Sarah's vote with the intention of voting against Tai twice, but Sarah revealed that the advantage was non-transferable and reclaimed the advantage from Cirie. In the ensuing scramble, Sarah used her advantage to steal Tai's vote. Scheming with outsiders Brad and Troyzan, the three targeted Cirie's number one ally, Michaela, who was subsequently blindsided.\n\nAfter returning from Tribal Council, Sarah confronted Cirie about using her advantage, but Cirie told her she did that in order to save her from Tai who was coming after her. After confirming that Tai was indeed going after her, she apologized to Cirie. When Brad again won immunity on Day 36, he pressured Tai into giving him one of his Hidden Immunity Idols and targeting Aubry that night. Tai, put off by Brad's attitude, conspires with Aubry and Cirie. At Tribal Council, Cirie, Aubry, and Tai voted against Sarah; Sarah and Troyzan voted for Tai; and Brad voted for Aubry. Tai played his idols on himself and Aubry, while Sarah played her immunity-granting Legacy Advantage, which prompted Troyzan to play his own idol. As Cirie was the only player left without immunity, she was automatically eliminated despite receiving no votes against her. When snuffing her torch, host Jeff Probst has Cirie say his famous trademark line "the tribe has spoken", and everybody claps in respect, including the jury and the live studio audience.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Cirie told Brad that it appeared that Sierra was the brains behind their alliance, and challenged him to prove the jury wrong; she also questioned Troyzan's lack of leadership and decision making. In the end, she voted for Sarah to win, which she did in a 7-3-0 vote over Brad and Troyzan.	9	0	6	8	9	2.79	36	0.25
14	Michaela Bradshaw	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Michaela_Bradshaw	2	Michaela started on the game on the Mana tribe. After Mana lost the first Immunity Challenge, Ciera Eastin was targeted by most of the tribe for openly scheming against Tony Vlachos and Caleb Reynolds. However, after Tony told Michaela that she was the decoy target, Michaela became uneasy, causing the majority to consider voting her out for her volatility. At Tribal Council, Ciera was voted out in a unanimous 9-1 vote, with Ciera voting against Michaela. After Mana lost immunity again on Day 6, the tribe's former winners, Tony and Sandra Diaz-Twine openly targeted each other. Though Michaela was hesitant to get rid of Tony, saying she wanted to keep the tribe strong, she joined the majority in voting him out.\n\nAs a result of the tribe switch on Day 7, Michaela, along with Sandra, Aubry Bracco, Jeff Varner, and Malcolm Freberg were switched to the Nuku tribe where they were joined by original Nuku member J.T. Thomas. The original Mana alliance on Nuku faced a heavy blow on Night 11 as Malcolm was blindsided during the Joint Tribal Council with the new Mana tribe. After the next Reward Challenge, J.T. and Michaela squabbled over the latter's consumption of the sugar they had previously won. In order to keep the two fighting, Sandra ate the rest of the sugar, causing J.T. to accuse Michaela of the act. After Nuku lost immunity, Michaela and Sandra decided to try to blindside J.T., while Michaela was targeted by Aubry and J.T., leaving Jeff as the swing vote. While she received votes from Aubry and J.T., Jeff sided with her and Sandra, blindsiding J.T.. After J.T. left, Sandra admitted that she ate the sugar, much to Michaela's amusement.\n\nThe next day, another tribe switch occurred. Michaela and Aubry were switched back to Mana, where she and Hali Ford were targeted by Brad Culpepper, though the tribe won the remaining Immunity Challenges before merging. When the tribes merged into the Maku Maku tribe on Day 20, Michaela was targeted by most of the others for her personality. Michaela then formed a bond with Cirie Fields, telling Cirie that she wanted both of them to be the first pair of African-American women to make it to the end. Cirie then began mentoring her and gave her advice on how to play the game. Cirie ultimately saved her from elimination by telling the majority to make Hali the main target. At the first post-merge Tribal Council, Michaela received four votes, but Hali was successfully voted out.\n\nDuring the Reward Challenge on Day 25, Michaela was not picked to join either team and was thus relegated to watching the challenge from the sit-out bench. Stewing, she failed to notice a scroll labeled with "Secret Advantage" placed at the foot of the bench. Sarah Lacina spotted the advantage, later revealed to be a Vote Steal, after the challenge and managed to claim it for herself.\n\nOn Day 29, Michaela found herself disliking the idea of voting out any members of her majority Tavua Alliance, fearing it would allow the remnants of the minority Power Six alliance the chance to get back in the game. She and Sarah were the deciding votes and ended up going with the plan to send alliance member Zeke Smith to the jury. After not being selected to go on the loved ones reward, Michaela became fed up with the way her allies neglected her and started a secret alliance with members of the minority alliance, Sierra Dawn Thomas, Tai Trang, and Troyzan Robertson, promising to align with Brad to target Andrea Boehlke. Either way, she still ended up voting with the majority at the next Tribal Council on Day 32 against Sierra, sending her to the jury.\n\nThe following day, Michaela, exhausted and hungry, then asked Brad to catch fish for the tribe, but he took it the wrong way and called her a "diva". On Day 35, Cirie revealed to her a plan she had to use Sarah's Vote Steal advantage, which Sarah had given to Cirie right before departing for Tribal Council as a sign of trust, to save Sarah and blindside Tai, but when the grand plan was foiled by the rules of the advantage, Sarah secretly targeted her for being too close to Cirie. After Sarah stole Tai's vote, she convinced Brad and Troyzan to help blindside Michaela in a 4-2-1 vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Michaela accused Brad of only getting to know the people he wanted to know, and said she did not understand why certain jurors took things personally. She praised Sarah's social and strategic gameplay and ended up voting for her to win, which she did in a 7-3-0 vote over Brad and Troyzan.	5	0	7	7	8	1.85	35	0.14
5	J.T. Thomas	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/J.T._Thomas	3	J.T. started on Nuku which won the first two challenges. He was the only member on Nuku to remain on Nuku after the Tribe Switch. He was joined by Mana's Malcolm Freberg, Jeff Varner, Aubry Bracco, Michaela Bradshaw, and fellow Heroes vs. Villains castmate Sandra Diaz-Twine. J.T. stranded his new tribemates out on the ocean while on a snorkeling trip in order to look for a Hidden Immunity Idol, but failed to find it.\n\nOn Day 10, he tried to convince Malcolm to target Sandra. On Day 11, Tavua won immunity, but the losing tribes, Nuku and Mana, had to go to a Joint Tribal Council and vote out one member instead of two. J.T. wanted Tai Trang out for being sneaky, but Sandra wanted Sierra Dawn Thomas out. At Tribal Council, J.T. leaked to Mana member Brad Culpepper that Sierra was the target and they should vote for Sandra. However, this backfired when Tai played his Hidden Immunity Idol on Sierra and Mana's votes sent Malcolm out of the game.\n\nAfter returning from Tribal Council, J.T. was confronted of leaking their plan to Brad, but he denied it. The next day he managed to find a Hidden Immunity Idol. After the Reward Challenge, J.T. and Michaela squabbled over the latter's consumption of the sugar they had previously won. In order to keep the two fighting, Sandra ate the rest of the sugar, causing J.T. to accuse Michaela of the act.\n\nNuku lost the Immunity Challenge. J.T. talked to Aubry, Jeff, and Sandra about voting out Michaela. Aubry sided with him while Sandra plotted with Michaela to blindside J.T., so Jeff was the swing vote. J.T. decided not to bring his idol to Tribal Council. However, this backfired as Jeff sided with Sandra and Michaela, blindsiding J.T.	6	1	16	3	5	3.8	13	0.46
13	Andrea Boehlke	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Andrea_Boehlke	3	Andrea started on Nuku. Nuku won the first two challenges. She was switched to the brand-new Tavua tribe after the first tribe switch which won the next three challenges, then back to Nuku after the second tribe switch. After Nuku lost immunity on Days 16 and 18, Andrea joined the majority in voting out Sandra Diaz-Twine and Jeff Varner.\n\nAfter the merge, Andrea won the first individual Immunity Challenge. On Day 25, she was targeted by the Power Six alliance. At Tribal Council, she received five votes but Power Six member Sarah Lacina flipped to her side, narrowly blindsiding Debbie Wanner. She won her second Immunity Challenge on Day 29. She then campaigned for her alliance member Zeke Smith's elimination because he had been targeting her for a while. Andrea got her way as Zeke was blindsided at Tribal Council. On Day 33, Andrea believed Brad Culpepper would be the target, both her and Aubry Bracco voted for Brad at Tribal Council, but the rest voted against her, so Andrea was blindsided. She took her elimination well and before she left Tribal Council, she playfully tickle-attacked her ally Cirie Fields after realizing Cirie had also voted for her.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Andrea commended Sarah Lacina's game but criticized her for the way she played with people's emotions, and she criticized Brad for not socializing with people on the bottom. Andrea was one of the seven jurors that voted for Sarah to win, saying she felt her game was overall far more strategic and better all around than Brad's, in spite of Brad's impressive number of immunity wins.	14	0	8	7	8	1.38	33	0.42
8	Hali Ford	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Hali_Ford	2	Entering the game wanting to play more like a "Cobra" compared to her first time, Hali was initially placed on the Mana tribe. By Day 6, the tribe had divided between two rival alliances: one led by Sandra Diaz-Twine and the other by Tony Vlachos. Hali sided with the former's faction, contributing to Tony's elimination at the second Tribal Council.\n\nHali remained on Manu following the tribe switch on Day 7, where she was left in a 4-2 minority alongside Caleb Reynolds against the original Nuku. When the tribe lost immunity again on Day 9, Hali became a potential target for elimination. However, due to Caleb's prior relationship with Tai Trang, he was eliminated over Hali in a unanimous 5-1 vote.\n\nOn Day 11, Tavua won immunity, and the losing tribes, Mana and Nuku, had to go to a Joint Tribal Council and vote out one member instead of two. At Tribal Council, Hali collaborated with her original Mana allies to blindside Brad Culpepper. However, after sensing disunity in the Nuku tribe, Hali ultimately voted with Mana, eliminating Malcolm Freberg. Following a second tribe switch on Day 14, Hali remained on Mana. As the tribe would go on to win the remaining Immunity challenges, Hali joined the merged tribe Maku Maku on Day 19.\n\nAn outsider to both of Nuku's major alliances, Hali found herself a target ahead of the first merged Tribal Council, alongside Michaela Bradshaw. Not wanting to strike at each other, both sides decided to split the vote between the Hali and Michaela. While she was originally the secondary target, Cirie Fields and Zeke Smith managed to turn the vote onto Hali to save Michaela, who they felt they could work with more. Thus At Tribal Council, Hali was blindsided in a 7-4-1-1 vote, becoming the first member of the jury once again.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Hali questioned Brad for insinuating that he had used condescension as a strategy. In the end, Hali voted for Sarah Lacina to be the Sole Survivor, which she did in a 7-3-0 vote over Brad and Troyzan Robertson.	4	0	13	6	5	1.13	21	0.19

18	Ben Driebergen	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ben_Driebergen	2	Due to his past as a marine, Ben was initially placed on the Levu tribe consisting of "Heroes". Ashley Nolan and JP Hilsabeck immediately wanted to work with Ben due to his strength and perceived trustworthiness. Ben initially was close to Alan Ball, but that relationship worsened after Alan went off on JP and Ashley. When Levu lost the first Immunity Challenge, Ben joined the rest of the tribe in voting out Katrina Radke. Following her elimination, Ben became closer to Chrissy Hofbeck after the latter identified Ben as the best possible ally in this tribe. However, any further action with his fellow Levus was put on hold as a tribe switch occurred that put him on the Yawa with three original Sokos (Mike Zahalsky, Cole Medders, and Jessica Johnston) and one original Yawa, Lauren Rimmer. Ben and Lauren became close as the only non-Healers on the new Yawa tribe. Cole rubbed Ben the wrong way with his eating habits, and both Ben and Lauren tried to turn Mike against Cole. However, Yawa won the next three Immunity Challenges.\n\nAt the merge, Ben was a swing vote between the Soko Alliance and the remaining Heroes and Hustlers, the latter two groups which banded together. Lauren initially wanted to work with the Healers, but Ben's relationship with Chrissy and his rivalry with Cole caused him to prefer the Heroes and Hustlers. This led to the Pagonging of the original Sokos until the final nine. During that process, Lauren told Ben about her Extra Vote advantage, Ryan Ulrich told Ben about his Hidden Immunity Idol, and Joe Mena tried to use Ben's marine status against him. Ben started to gain a target on his back as the leader of the majority alliance, referred to as "King Arthur" which would dub his alliance The Round Table. On Day 25, Lauren won a reward and included Ben, Ashley, and Devon Pinto to discuss making a move against JP, Chrissy, or Ryan Ulrich. This plan was also fueled by Devon's lack of trust in Ryan after he told both Devon and Ben about his Hidden Immunity Idol. During the reward, Ben found a second merged idol (the first being in Ryan's possession). Back at camp, Devon nominated Ben to act as a spy by voting for Mike in order to gain information from the new minority after the vote. The plan worked as his alliance and Joe and Mike blindsided JP, and Ryan and Chrissy had no idea Ben was involved.\n\nFor the next few days, Ben pretended to be betrayed by Ashley, Lauren, and Devon, much to Joe's amusement. After Chrissy won the next Immunity Challenge, Ben suggested to his alliance that they take out Joe because he was no longer needed. However, Ben's status as a strong player began to worry his allies. Ashley and Lauren considered voting Ben out before Joe, but Devon was unsure. Ultimately, they blindsided Joe and flushed Ryan's idol, relegating Mike to the minority along with Ryan and Chrissy. Returning from Tribal Council, Chrissy found out that Ben was playing double agent and called him out on it which caused the two to argue. On Day 31, Ben met his wife Kelly at the Loved Ones Challenge. Things continued to heat up on Day 33 as Lauren, Devon, and Ashley were caught by Ben planning to vote him out. Ben tried to target Lauren, who had found the rehidden idol as well as her Extra Vote advantage. Panicking for numbers, Lauren gave Mike half of her idol as a sign of trust. At Tribal Council, Mike threw Lauren's idol in the fire which allowed Ben to successfully eliminate his target in Lauren, despite needing his own idol to negate everyone else's votes against him.\n\nAt that point, Ben became the undisputed target. All the other contestants made it explicitly clear, though Ben continued to try to find other avenues. Unable to convince the tribe or win immunity, Ben resorted to finding idols and then taking out his chosen targets. On Day 36, Ben found his second idol moments before going to Tribal Council and played it before the votes were cast, and Ashley was sent home. On Day 37, Ben played his third idol (which he found hours after the previous Tribal Council) normally and forced a tie between Devon (his target) and Mike (who received Devon's vote). Mike was voted out in the revote. With no more idols in the game, Ben thought he needed to win immunity to ensure he made it to the end. He came close on multiple occasions in what was a back-and-forth Final Immunity Challenge, but was unable to capitalize and Chrissy won the challenge. However, a twist changed the Tribal Council from a standard vote to a forced fire-making challenge. Chrissy saved Ryan and forced Devon and Ben to participate in the challenge, in which Ben succeeded.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Ben's argument to the jury was that he was constantly playing hard in all facets of the game, especially in finding Hidden Immunity Idols. He was applauded for finding idols, but panned (particularly by Joe) for his weak social game, which Ben explained was the most difficult part of the game for him due to his PTSD from his marine tenure. In spite of this, Ben's astounding idol-finding run and his ability to beat the odds and make it to the end were preferred over Chrissy's dominance in Immunity Challenges and Ryan's subtle gameplay, and he was awarded the title of Sole Survivor in a 5-2-1 vote.	10	3	1	8	9	5	39	0.26

20	Wendell Holland	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Wendell_Holland	2	Wendell was initially placed on the Naviti tribe where he proved to be an asset to the tribe early on with his background as a furniture designer, as he used his building skills to help construct the shelter. He also built a strong bond with Domenick Abbate. At camp, when Sebastian Noel told Wendell that he wanted Domenick out, Wendell notified Domenick about it, leading to him stating that Chris Noble was the ringleader of the tribe mainly because of a rivalry between them that started after the opening Reward Challenge. Naviti however won the first two Immunity Challenges.\n\nWhen a tribe switch occurred on Day 7, Wendell stayed on Naviti along with Chris, Domenick, Angela Perkins, and Morgan Ricke. Domenick, Morgan, and Wendell still targeted Chris and were also wary of Angela since she never worked with them until the switch. However, after losing the Day 9 Immunity Challenge, their plan was foiled when Chris was sent to Ghost Island via rock draw, causing a 4-4 split between the former Naviti and Malolo members. Domenick tried to build trust with the Malolos to vote out Angela by showing them a fake Hidden Immunity Idol, but this caused James Lim to distrust him and targeted one of the trio of Wendell, Domenick, and Morgan. At Tribal Council, Wendell, Morgan, and Domenick targeted Angela for being Chris's right-hand man, but Morgan was blindsided by the former Malolos. Back at camp following Morgan's blindside, Domenick and Wendell were left in the minority, but they had hope when Domenick told Wendell that he found a real idol and also when Donathan Hurley and Laurel Johnson talked to them about forming a Final Four Alliance. However, any strategy was put on hold as Naviti won the next two Immunity Challenges.\n\nA second tribe switch occurred on Day 15. Wendell, along with Chris and Laurel, were switched to the new Yanuya tribe. Yanuya won the next Immunity Challenge after Wendell led them from behind. After Yanuya won the Day 18 Reward Challenge, Wendell found an idol that was revealed to be the Immunity Necklace that Erik Reichenbach gave to Natalie Bolton in Survivor: Micronesia. Yanuya won the last challenge before the merge.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Lavita tribe on Day 20, the Naviti Alliance initially planned to use their 8-5 numbers advantage to pick off the former Malolos. However, Chris and Domenick's rivalry reached a boiling point. Domenick and Wendell approached Chris about the three of them working together, but were unsuccessful. At Tribal Council, Wendell joined almost the entire tribe in blindsiding Chris. The following morning, Wendell and Domenick reaffirmed their alliance with Donathan and Laurel. After the Day 25 Immunity Challenge, Michael Yerger wanted to target Wendell for his social game and tried to rally the former Malolos to vote against him. When the Naviti Alliance planned to split the vote between Michael and Libby Vincek, Libby was worried, but Wendell assured her that she was safe. At Tribal Council, Wendell joined the rest of the tribe in the split vote plan, with Libby being voted out after Michael played a Hidden Immunity Idol. The foursome of Wendell, Domenick, Donathan, and Laurel then took control of the game by voting out Desiree Afuye for trying to flip on the Naviti Alliance, then took out Michael during the Double Elimination twist.\n\nAt the Family Visit, Sebastian won the challenge and chose Wendell, Domenick, and Donathan to go with him. However, Wendell decided to decline the reward to volunteer to go to Ghost Island for an advantage. This move however, left the women bitter and had Kellyn Bechtold try to orchestrate his blindside. When Wendell got to Ghost Island, he received Malcolm Freberg's Final Immunity Challenge advantage from Survivor: Philippines. At the next Immunity Challenge, Wendell got to use his advantage, but he still lost the challenge. Despite being targeted by Kellyn, the Final Four Alliance stuck together in blindsiding Chelsea Townsend for being a physical threat after she won back-to-back Immunity Challenges. At the final seven however, Donathan turned on Wendell and Domenick, as he knew he was on the bottom and that he could not beat either of them in the end. Despite this, they spared him at Tribal Council when the vote resulted in a tie and voted Kellyn out in the revote.\n\nWendell and Domenick then went after Donathan for trying to betray their alliance. When Wendell won the final six Reward/Immunity Challenge, he chose Angela and Sebastian to go with him. Although Wendell and Domenick wanted to blindside Sebastian next for his likability, Wendell stated he chose Sebastian to make him still feel good about him in order to win his jury vote. At Tribal Council, Donathan was spared again as Sebastian was blindsided when he did not play his Extra Vote after Domenick made a bluff with his idol. When Wendell won the next Immunity Challenge, he wanted to make a move against Domenick and to play his idol on someone to try to gain the jury's respect. At Tribal Council, Wendell played his idol for Laurel to solidify their bond, but it only negated one vote and Donathan was finally voted out. When Domenick won the Final Immunity Challenge on Day 38, Domenick finally decided to target Wendell, but had to consider who had to go against him in the fire-making challenge. Domenick privately considered giving his Immunity Necklace to Angela and taking on Wendell himself in the fire-making challenge. At Tribal Council, however, Domenick chose to keep immunity and brought Laurel to the end, forcing Wendell to go against Angela in the fire-making challenge. Wendell ultimately won the fire-making challenge, making Angela the 10th member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Wendell explained how he used his building to help build his social game and that he also flew under-the-radar to let Domenick do most of the dirty work despite receiving votes against him a few times. While the jury praised him for his social game and laid-back strategy, they questioned his strategic moves compared to Domenick's. Following the jury voting, host Jeff Probst immediately read the votes, revealing a tie for the first time in Survivor history 5-5 between Wendell and Domenick. As the third place finalist, Laurel became the 11th and final juror and had to cast the winning vote. At the finale, it was revealed that Laurel voted for Wendell due to their bond throughout the game, making Wendell the Sole Survivor of Survivor: Ghost Island.	13	1	1	9	8	2.79	39	0.33

20	Nick Wilson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Nick_Wilson	2	Nick was initially placed on the David tribe. Early on, Nick was more interested in forming alliances than working at camp, but unbeknownst to him, Carl Boudreaux became irritated with Nick's laziness and began gunning for him should David lose the first challenge. Although David did indeed lose the first Immunity Challenge on Day 3, Tribal Council was cancelled due to Pat Cusack being medically evacuated, thus sparing Nick. The following morning, Nick regrouped and formed an alliance with Christian Hubicki. When David again lost immunity, both he and Christian found themselves as the swing votes for the impeding Tribal Council. Despite Nick wanting Lyrsa Torres out, he eventually joined Christian in voting out Jessica Peet. Upon returning to camp, both Nick and Christian told Davie Rickenbacker that Gabby Pascuzzi was responsible for Jessica's elimination, leading to Nick plotting with Davie and Bi Nguyen about taking out Gabby. However, David won the next Immunity Challenge, putting any plans on hold.\n\nDuring the Tribe Switch on Day 10, Nick and Lyrsa were switched to the new Jabeni tribe, where they were outnumbered three to two by the original Goliaths. After Jabeni lost immunity on Day 15, Natalie Cole tried to force Nick into giving her his jacket on behalf of Angelina Keeley, earning Nick's ire. Both he and Lyrsa then tried to convince Mike White to turn against Natalie, who had been rubbing her original Goliath tribemates the wrong way with her abrasive personality. At Tribal Council, Mike sided with Nick and Lyrsa, voting out Natalie. When Jabeni lost immunity again, Nick and Mike contemplated on which of Angelina or Lyrsa to take out. Eventually, Nick joined Angelina and Mike in sending Lyrsa home.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Kalokalo tribe on Day 18, Nick became a part of a cross-tribal alliance with Christian and Gabby, along with Goliaths Mike, Alec Merlino, and Alison Raybould. At the first post-merge Tribal Council, he joined the rest of the tribe in unanimously eliminating Elizabeth Olson. The following morning, Nick and Davie found a clue to an advantage. With Carl and Davie's help, Nick was able to find the advantage, which turned out to be a Vote Steal. With the David Alliance down in numbers at the following Tribal Council, Davie played his Hidden Immunity Idol on Christian, and Nick, Christian, and Davie were able to blindside John Hennigan by splitting the minority vote and flushing one of Dan Rengering's idols. Still down in numbers to the opposing Goliath Alliance, Nick used his advantage at the next Tribal Council on Day 25 to steal Alison's vote. Carl then used his Idol Nullifier in tandem with Nick's Vote Steal to nullify Dan's second idol, sending Dan to the jury.\n\nNick and Davie woke up early the next morning to search for a new idol, with Nick finding a clue saying that the idol was on the other side of the island and that he would have to wait until dark to find it. That night, Nick snuck off to find the idol, and successfully claimed it for himself. Feeling confident, he then took the offer to sit out of the next Immunity Challenge, along with Angelina and Carl. At Tribal Council, he joined the rest of the tribe in unanimously voting out Alec for being a physical threat. With the David Alliance now in the majority, Carl led the charge to eliminate Alison next. Although Nick was on board with the plan, Gabby became irritated with Carl's approach. At the next Tribal Council, both Christian and Gabby betrayed the David Alliance and joined Alison, Mike, and Kara Kay in blindsiding Carl.\n\nUpon returning from Tribal Council, Nick was upset with Christian over Carl's blindside and declared that his alliance with Christian was over. The following morning, Nick met his father Jim at the family visit. Nick and Angelina won the subsequent Reward Challenge, choosing Davie and Mike to join them. During the reward, they voiced their intentions to reach the final four together. Following the Immunity Challenge, Nick agreed with Gabby about blindsiding Christian, but then he, Angelina, and Mike came up with a plan to put two votes on Gabby in case Christian played his idol. At Tribal Council, Christian played the idol on himself, and Gabby was instead sent to the jury.\n\nAfter Gabby's elimination, Nick made a fake idol and "found" it under the raft in front of Angelina, Christian, and Mike so that they would not search for a real one. However, Davie was leery of Nick's ruse and told Christian that Nick possibly had two idols and that he planned to blindside Nick. Leading up to the next Tribal Council, Nick realized that Alison was a physical threat. He revealed to Davie that his raft idol was fake, and Davie agreed to vote against Alison with him. However, Mike pulled Nick aside and told him that Davie had targeted him earlier, before trying to get Nick on board with voting out Christian before Davie. At Tribal Council, Davie played an idol on himself, prompting Nick to play his fake idol to get a read on his tribemates' reactions. He then played his real idol on himself, but received no votes, and Christian was voted out.\n\nNick won his first individual immunity on Day 36, and chose to share the reward with Angelina and Mike. On the reward, Nick and Mike helped Angelina find an idol for herself before Nick and Angelina agreed to target Alison next. At Tribal Council however, Nick was shocked when the former Goliath Alliance banded together to blindside Davie. An angry Nick confronted Angelina and Mike over Davie's blindside, and worked to ensure that Alison would go home next. After Nick won the next Immunity Challenge, however, he and Kara considered taking out Mike instead for being a threat. However, they eventually sided with Angelina and Mike to send Alison to the jury. Nick then won the Final Immunity Challenge on Day 38. He then voiced his intention to take Angelina to the end, prompting Kara and Mike to practice making fire. Mike ultimately beat Kara to join Nick and Angelina in the Final Three.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Nick was commended for his social and strategic acumen, as well as his immunity wins, but was criticized for his game peaking too early. In the end, Nick's strategic moves, strong social game, and underdog status were preferred over Mike's late strategic dominance and Angelina's selfish gameplay, and he was awarded the title of Sole Survivor over Mike and Angelina in a 7-3-0 vote.	10	1	1	7	8	4.1	39	0.26

9	Kelley Wentworth	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kelley_Wentworth	3	Kelley was one of four returning players to compete in Survivor: Edge of Extinction. Kelley, along with David Wright, joined the Manu tribe, where she bonded with Lauren O'Connell and soon founded the majority Manu Alliance against Reem Daly, Keith Sowell, and Wendy Diaz due to them isolating themselves from the rest of the tribe. After Manu lost the first Immunity Challenge, Kelley and Lauren were targeted by Reem for being a power couple, but the Manu Alliance wanted to target Reem as her motherly instincts rubbed most of the tribe the wrong way. Wendy's allegiance to Reem soon caused the alliance to split the vote between the two. At Tribal Council, Reem tried to throw Kelley under the bus, as her gameplay in Cambodia made her a legend. Despite this, the Manu Alliance stuck to their plan in splitting the votes between Reem and Wendy, voting the former out first.\n\nThe result of Reem's "elimination" led to a strategic rivalry between Kelley and Reem's closest ally Wendy, as the latter continued to target her as she was the leader of the Manu Alliance. Kelley's closest ally Lauren soon found the tribe's Hidden Immunity Idol and kept it secret after Kelley led an open idol hunt to prevent Wendy from finding it. After losing the second Immunity Challenge on Day 6 to Keith's expense, most of the tribe targeted Keith for his weakness in the challenge. As Kelley and Wendy continued to target each other, David, Chris Underwood, and Rick Devens wanted to target Kelley for being a bigger threat. When Chris approached Wardog DaSilva to get a fifth vote against Kelley, Wardog tried to convince Chris to get rid of Keith instead and use Kelley as a shield. Despite feeling paranoid as the trust she put in other people cost her the game in her past two seasons, at Tribal Council, Kelley was spared due to Keith being a liability in challenges.\n\nAfter Manu lost their third Immunity Challenge in a row on Day 8, Kelley, Lauren, and Wardog targeted Wendy after she hid the tribe's flint to prevent them from cooking the chickens they won in the Day 7 Reward Challenge. However, Chris leaked the plan to Wardog about targeting Kelley after David instructed him not to, leading the trio of Kelley, Lauren, and Wardog to change the target to Chris. At Tribal Council, the three got their way when David and Rick betrayed Chris for supposedly being untrustworthy and to prevent Kelley from knowing that they were against her.\n\nOn Day 9, a tribe switch occurred, and all the original Manu members left except Wendy were switched to the new Lesu tribe. When Lesu lost the following Immunity Challenge on Day 11, Kelley and Lauren targeted Rick for being the most likely to get along with the rival Kama tribe at the merge, while David and Rick targeted Lauren after she got sick and couldn't eat and also in fear that Kelley had an idol. This left Wardog as the swing vote. At Tribal Council, Wardog stuck with Kelley and Lauren in voting out Rick. After Rick was voted out, Wardog tried to convince Kelley to target her closest ally Lauren due to her illness, and Kelley took it into consideration. However, Lesu finally won immunity on Day 13, and for the first time this season, Kelley abstained from Tribal Council. After losing the following Reward Challenge on Day 14, Kelley became frustrated by David and Wardog's poor challenge performances and the fact that Joe Anglim was carrying the rival Kama tribe in every challenge. She soon became frustrated by Wardog's scheming against Lauren and his laziness around camp. On Day 16, Lesu and Manu lost the Immunity Challenge, which sent them to a Joint Tribal Council. Before Tribal Council, Wardog suggested targeting Wendy in hopes that her tribemates would not risk a rock draw tiebreaker to save her, but Kelley and Lauren were again frustrated by Wardog's refusal to listen to anyone else's ideas. Lesu then searched for the idol which Kelley found and shared with Lauren, who in turn told Kelley about her idol she found back on Manu. At Tribal Council, Lesu went with their plan voting Wendy while Manu voted Lauren, forcing a tie. In the revote, Eric Hafemann, Gavin Whitson, and Victoria Baamonde joined Lesu in voting Wendy out unanimously.\n\nThe three tribes merged the next day, but to their surprise, the six previously voted out players returned to compete in a re-entry challenge. Jeff Probst revealed that they'd been living on the Edge of Extinction waiting for their chance to return to the game. Ultimately, Rick won the challenge and joined the newly merged Vata tribe. After the merge feast, Kelley, Lauren, and Wardog tried to spread to the Kama majority by targeting Rick again. Although the Kama minority alliance of Aurora McCreary and Joe were open to Kelley's plan, Julie Rosenberg was appalled by the Lesu trio's cruelty to send Rick back to the Edge after he returned. After the first individual Immunity Challenge on Day 19, the Lesu trio continued to target Rick, but unbeknownst to them, Julie leaked Kelley's plan to Rick, this in turn caused him and David to rally votes against Kelley. At Tribal Council, Joe and Kelley's alliances split their votes between David and Rick, while David and Rick voted Kelley. However, amidst their conflict, the Kama Six alliance took the opportunity to blindside Joe due to him being a physical threat.\n\nFollowing Joe's elimination, Kelley, Lauren, and Wardog plotted to align with Aurora and regroup with David and Rick to dethrone the Kama Six alliance, but David and Rick had aligned with Kama Six leaders Eric and Ron Clark for long-term safety. After the Day 22 Immunity Challenge, Wardog took the opportunity to convince Kama Six members Julia Carter, Gavin, and Victoria to turn against Eric and Ron. At Tribal Council, Kelley's plan worked as David had regrouped with Kelley and Aurora, Gavin, Julia, and Victoria flipped and joined the Manu Alliance in blindsiding Eric.\n\nDespite voting with the Manu Alliance, Julia wanted to regroup the Kama Six alliance. After the following Immunity Challenge, the Kama Six's quiet behavior around camp alarmed the Manu Alliance. In a chaotic Tribal Council, Julia and Aurora's comments stirred up a series of conversations with Julie feeling like she was on the bottom of the Kama Six and openly said she was ready to "jump ship" and join the Manu Alliance and threw out Julia's name. The chaos that ensued led to the entire tribe except Aurora voting out Julia.\n\nNow in a new majority alliance, the new alliance of Kelley, Lauren, Wardog, Julie, Gavin, and Ron targeted Aurora, feeling that her comments cost Julia the game. However, after their plan was thwarted when Aurora won the following Immunity Challenge, they decided to target David. David and Rick scrambled to recruit the former Kamas into targeting the tight Lesu trio, but at Tribal Council, the former Kamas stuck with the new alliance in voting David out, with Rick as the next target. However, Rick shocked everyone when he won the next Immunity Challenge with the help of an advantage he received from David on the Edge of Extinction. Following the Immunity Challenge, the majority alliance decided to go with their earlier plan in targeting Aurora, but Wardog decided to betray Kelley for being the last returning player standing by recruiting Aurora, Rick, Ron, and Victoria. At Tribal Council, Kelley voted with her alliance against Aurora, but she was blindsided when Wardog betrayed her, sending her to the Edge of Extinction with her idol still in her possession. When she arrived on the Edge, she told the others about her and Lauren's idol.\n\nThe next day, Kelley was devastated by her elimination and how her time competing on the season was disappointing, but Reem managed to reconcile and share an emotional moment with her. On Day 35, Kelley competed along with ten other castaways in the second re-entry challenge, but she lost the challenge to Chris, eliminating her along with nine others.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Kelley leaking Lauren's idol to Chris on the Edge of Extinction became a major topic as it helped benefit Chris's time back in the game. Kelley then stated that she built a closer bond with Gavin out of the Final Three. Kelley voted for Gavin to win the title of Sole Survivor, but he lost to Chris in a 9-4-0 vote.	3	1	10	7	8	2.3	27	0.11
8	David Wright	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/David_Wright	2	David was one of four returnees to compete in Survivor: Edge of Extinction. David and fellow returnee Kelley Wentworth joined the Manu tribe. Unlike his first season, David quickly found himself in a majority alliance against outsiders Reem Daly, Keith Sowell, and Wendy Diaz. After losing the first Immunity Challenge, David wanted to vote Reem out, to which most of the tribe agreed. Reem tried pleading her case to David and Rick Devens, and she continued to plead her case at Tribal Council, but she was voted out first.\n\nDavid began to form a bond with Rick, and they were both open for blindsiding Kelley. They also talked to Wendy, who said she'd be willing to vote off Kelley when they're ready. After losing the second Immunity Challenge on Day 6, Manu targeted Keith due to his weakness. Despite still wanting Kelley out, David joined the majority in voting Keith out that night.\n\nAfter losing the third Immunity Challenge in a row, David, Rick and Wendy were all in agreement to voting off Kelley. David also convinced Chris Underwood to vote for Kelley, but not to tell Wardog DaSilva or Lauren O'Connell about the plan as they were closest to Kelley. However, Chris leaked the plan to Wardog who then spread a new plan to vote off Chris. Despite David still wanting Kelley gone most, he joined Wardog, Kelley, Rick and Lauren in blindsiding Chris.\n\nOn Day 9, a Tribe Switch occurred, and all the original Manu members left except Wendy were switched over to the new Lesu tribe. After losing the following Immunity Challenge, David decided he and Rick would vote for Lauren instead of Kelley in fear that Kelley had a Hidden Immunity Idol. With Kelley and Lauren against David and Rick, this left Wardog as the swing vote. Wardog decided to stick with Kelley, and David lost his closest ally Rick that night.\n\nDavid was now left on the bottom of the Lesu tribe. Fortunately, Lesu managed to win their first Immunity Challenge on Day 13, saving David for another day. However, Lesu would have to return to Tribal Council on Day 16 alongside the new Manu tribe. The vote ended in a tie between Lauren and Wendy, but the group decided to unanimously vote off Wendy at the revote.\n\nThe three tribes merged the following day, but to their surprise, the six previously voted out players returned to compete in a reentry duel. Jeff Probst revealed that they'd been living on the Edge of Extinction waiting for their chance to return to the game. Ultimately, Rick won the duel and joined the new merged tribe. Rick gave David half of a Hidden Immunity Idol that he had been gifted as a reward for coming back, and the two continued their plan against the former Lesu members. However, amidst their conflict the Kama Six took the opportunity to blindside former Kama Joe Anglim due to his threat status.\n\nKelley confronted David and told him that Lesu needed to regroup and pull in Aurora McCreary to dethrone the Kama Six. However, Rick was not happy with the idea, as he was still hurt by Wardog for blindsiding him. Meanwhile, Wardog was taking the opportunity to convince members of the Kama Six to go against Ron Clark and Eric Hafemann since they were calling all the shots. At Tribal Council, David joined the majority in blindsiding Eric.\n\nDespite voting differently, David and Rick wanted to rekindle their friendship and decide who'd get custody of the idol they'd previously split between each other. At Tribal Council, the two feared they were on the bottom, and Rick gave his idol half to David for David to play. However, the move proved to be in vain as Julia Carter had received the majority of votes, thus sending her to the Edge of Extinction.\n\nUnfortunately, David and Rick were now at the bottom as Wardog's alliance had decided to target them. Unable to win immunity, David was voted out on Day 25 and sent to the Edge of Extinction. The next morning, David found an advantage for the next Immunity Challenge that he'd have to give to someone still in the game. He gave it to his ally Rick, who went on to win the Immunity Challenge.\n\nOn Day 35, David and the other castaways on the Edge of Extinction were given one last chance to reenter the game. David ultimately lost the reentry duel to Chris and was permanently eliminated from the game.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, David voted for Chris, who went on to become the Sole Survivor in a 9-4-0 vote.	2	0	11	8	9	2.2	25	0.08
5	Joe Anglim	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Joe_Anglim	3	Joe was originally placed on the Kama tribe, along with fellow returning player Aubry Bracco. However, the two found themselves on the outs of their tribe, with only Aurora McCreary aligning with them. He and Aubry were immediately targeted by the Kama Six alliance, who resented having returning players in the game and viewed the two as threats. Though Joe tried to ingratiate himself with the rest of the tribe with his work ethic, the majority remained steadfast in targeting the returning players, at one point overhearing a conversation between Ron Clark and Victoria Baamonde on which of him, Aubry, or Aurora to vote out should Kama lose an Immunity Challenge. However, Joe's strength in challenges contributed to Kama winning the first three Immunity Challenges, saving them from Tribal Council.\n\nOn Day 9, a Tribe Switch occurred, with Joe remaining on Kama, along with Aurora, Ron, Julia Carter, and Julie Rosenberg. Joe tried to pull Ron into an alliance with him and Aurora, believing to have a good rapport with him. Although Ron seemingly agreed with Joe's proposal, it was in reality just a ruse to distract him so that Julia would have time to search through Joe's bag for a possible Hidden Immunity Idol. After seeing his ally Aubry get voted out on the Manu tribe, Joe tried to pull Julia in, reasoning with her that they were both physical threats. Again, Kama won the next three Immunity Challenges, preventing any plans to vote Joe out.\n\nOn Day 17, the tribes merged into the Vata tribe. Seeing that the Kama Six was still intent on targeting him, Joe tried to strike an alliance with his fellow Cambodia returnee Kelley Wentworth and her allies Lauren O'Connell and Wardog DaSilva about working together to target Rick Devens. After losing the first individual Immunity Challenge to Julie, Joe was approached by Ron on who the Kama contingent would target from the Manu Alliance. However, Joe's vague answers worried Ron, who then pushed for the Kama Six to follow through with the plan to target Joe. At Tribal Council, Joe and Aurora voted against Rick; despite having a 7-6 advantage over the Kama Six, however, the internal disarray within the Manu Alliance prevented any solid plan from forming, allowing the Kama Six to take control, successfully voting out Joe, who elected to go to the Edge of Extinction.\n\nJoe did not mind being on the Edge of Extinction, giving him plenty of time to reflect on his cumulative Survivor experience. At the re-entry duel on Day 35, Joe was in the lead on the final stage of the challenge, but dropped his last ball, allowing Chris Underwood to win and earn a spot back in the game, permanently eliminating Joe and the other castaways on the Edge of Extinction from the game. At the Final Tribal Council, he voted for Chris to win the title of Sole Survivor.	8	0	14	8	6	0.8	19	0.42

3	Aubry Bracco	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Aubry_Bracco	3	Aubry was one of four returning players to compete in Survivor: Edge of Extinction. Aubry and fellow veteran Joe Anglim started the game on the Kama tribe. There, they were oblivious to the anti-veteran sentiment espoused by the first-time players; in particular, Eric Hafemann and Gavin Whitson wanted to target the returning players and decided to target Aubry so they could use Joe as a shield. On Day 4, Aubry tried to bond with the new players, but Julia Carter, Ron Clark, and Victoria Baamonde found her attempts disingenuous. The new players minus Aurora McCreary formed an alliance dubbed as the Kama Six against the trio of Aubry, Aurora, and Joe, but Aubry found the tribe's Hidden Immunity Idol and Kama won the first three Immunity Challenges, keeping the three safe.\n\nOn Day 9, a tribe switch occurred and Aubry was switched to Manu along with Eric, Gavin, and Victoria, joining original Manu member Wendy Diaz. Although Wendy seemed like an easy target due to being the only original Manu, Aubry described Wendy as an asset since she knew everything about the original Manu members. Manu won their first Immunity Challenge on Day 11, keeping Aubry safe again. On Day 12, Eric, Gavin, and Victoria decided to target Aubry over Wendy for being a bigger strategic threat. Victoria pretended to align with Aubry and Wendy against the men. When Manu lost the Day 13 Immunity Challenge, Aubry found an Extra Vote in her bag that was secretly gifted by Rick Devens from the Edge of Extinction. Aubry then discussed with Victoria and Wendy about blindsiding one of the men, but Wendy was reluctant to commit to the plan, causing Aubry to target her. Aubry realized she had options since she had an "alliance", an idol and an Extra Vote, but was worried since things seemed to go wrong for her in previous seasons. At Tribal Council, Aubry voted for Wendy, but she was blindsided by the entire tribe with her idol and Extra Vote in her possession. She was then given a chance to come back into the game. Aubry says "that's an easy decision" and took the torch and headed to the Edge of Extinction, adding it was "no brainer".\n\nThe next morning on the Edge of Extinction, Aubry said that she got burned last night with the idol and Extra Vote in her possession, stating it was a J.T. style embarrassment. Aubry continued on the Edge of Extinction until the first re-entry challenge on Day 17, Aubry competed along with Reem, Keith, Chris, Rick, and Wendy for a spot back in the game. Aubry lost the challenge to Rick, but then Jeff Probst surprised the losing contestants by offering them to return on the Edge of Extinction. For staying on the Edge of Extinction during the merge phase, Aubry, along with Reem and Chris were given seats on the jury. During this time, Aubry found two advantages, one that allowed her to practice for the second re-entry challenge, and an Extra Vote to assign to another player, which Aubry gave to Aurora. Aubry continued to stay and participate as a jury member until the second re-entry challenge on Day 35.\n\nOn Day 35, Aubry competed along with ten other castaways, Reem, Chris, Joe, Eric, Julia, David, Kelley, Wardog, Ron, and Aurora. During the challenge, Aubry struggled with the rope maze, causing her to fall behind and eventually lose the challenge, thus eliminating her and nine others.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Aubry stated that she felt like taxidermy during her time in the game due to the way she was treated for being a returning player. She even stated that Gavin was the only one of the Final Three that pretended he wanted to work with her. However, Gavin stated that he really did want to work with Aubry despite plotting against her. Aubry voted for Chris to win the title of Sole Survivor, which he did in a 9-4-0 vote.	5	1	16	5	6	1.8	13	0.38

16	Ethan Zohn	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ethan_Zohn	3	As part of the Boran tribe, Ethan was seen as a strong player who could potentially win challenges, and was not targeted early because of his congenial personality. During Boran's two back-to-back Immunity Challenges losses, he joined the majority to vote off Diane Ogden and Jessie Camacho. Over the next few days, Ethan would cement a long-term alliance with Lex van den Berghe and Tom Buchanan from his Boran tribe.\n\nA twist on Day 13 saw both of Ethan's alliance members switch from Boran to the Samburu tribe, leaving Ethan alone with old Boran members Kim Johnson and Clarence Black. Two of the new Boran members from the Samburu tribe, Teresa Cooper and Frank Garrison, had an old misunderstanding with younger original Samburu member Silas Gaither. So, on Day 15, a secret consensus was reached between Teresa and Frank and the original Borans (in which the two ex-Samburus would swear loyalty to Boran) by purposefully throwing the next Immunity Challenge in order to vote out the unpopular Silas. Both of Ethan's alliance members, Tom and Lex, remained safe on the Samburu tribe, carrying all three into the merge.\n\nEthan's alliance soon began to take control of the game, along with other members Kim J. and Kelly Goldsmith, all from the original Boran. They immediately targeted old Boran member Clarence due to his physical strength and he was voted out. But unbeknownst to Lex, he had received another vote at Tribal Council, who he believed had come from Kelly, but Teresa was the real culprit. This led Lex on a witch-hunt against Kelly which almost led to the demise of Ethan's alliance when Kelly possessed the power with the other four ex-Samburu members, Teresa, Frank, Kim Powers, and Brandon Quinton. But at the last minute, Brandon switched his vote, saving Lex and eliminating Kelly. But this move came back to haunt Brandon, when Ethan's alliance saw him as untrustworthy and voted him out at the next Tribal Council.\n\nEthan, Lex, Tom, and Kim J. regained control of the game, ousting previous Samburu members Frank, Kim P., and Teresa in the next three votes, carrying them into the final four. Kim J. surprised everyone by winning the remaining Immunity Challenges, putting the men (who already planned to be the final three) in trouble. Tom and Lex were eliminated respectively, thus bringing Ethan to Day 39.\n\nIn the end, Ethan beat Kim in a 5-2 vote to become the Sole Survivor, receiving votes from Kelly, Frank, Teresa, Tom, and Lex.	7	0	1	8	9	5.23	39	0.18

13	Tom Buchanan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Buchanan	2	Tom was initially placed on the Boran tribe where he was well-liked for his wacky personality and distinct, albeit unintelligible, accent. Despite this, he immediately revealed his bad side after losing the first Immunity Challenge—when Clarence Black made a percieved mistake in judgment by eating a whole can of beans together with Diane Ogden without the tribe's consensus, Tom, alongside the rest of his tribe, fumed about Clarence's mishap, even saying he would shoot Clarence if he had a gun, the situation led him to vote for Clarence at Boran's first two visits to Tribal Council. Nonetheless, Tom's comedic demeanor returned in time for the third Immunity Challenge—an SOS signal challenge—where he decided to strip down with a feather between his butt cheeks. This oddly helped grant Boran their first immunity win. Tom and the rest of Boran would also be safe for another three days after winning another Immunity Challenge on Day 12.\n\nOn Day 13, things were shaken when Tom, together with Kelly Goldsmith and Lex van den Berghe, were asked to "go on a quest", which ended up transferring them to the opposing Samburu tribe, while being replaced by Frank Garrison, Silas Gaither, and Teresa Cooper much to Tom's chagrin, as he wanted to go back to Boran. Upon reaching the Samburu camp, he and Lex became disappointed of how murky their new tribe's water hole was. As the former cleaners of Boran's waterhole, Tom and Lex found themselves doing their old jobs. After winning the fifth Immunity Challenge, Kelly discovered that Lindsey Richter had past Tribal Council votes. While being targeted by remnants of the Younger Samburu Alliance, Tom, Kelly, and Lex targeted Lindsey, despite Brandon Quinton's efforts to get them to vote against him instead, because if there were a deadlock tie vote between the ex-Borans and the original Samburus, Lindsey's previous votes would be taken into account, thus eliminating her. This materialized after Samburu lost the sixth Immunity Challenge, giving the original Boran tribe a 6-4 voting advantage over Samburu going into the merge.\n\nDespite Teresa's strong strategic gameplay, the former Samburus still failed to come together as a unified alliance, with the Boran Alliance successfully eliminating them one by one. Teresa was the last of the Samburus to be voted out, but not before turning Tom on Lex by telling Tom that Lex was persistent in keeping Brandon in the game beforehand. With only Borans left, Lex, Ethan Zohn, and Kim Johnson felt that Tom's goofiness was just a front to conceal his ulterior strategic motives, and he was eliminated at the final four in a 3-1 vote after Kim J. won immunity.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Tom felt that Ethan's more congenial personality made him more deserving than Kim J. to win and voted for him to win the title of Sole Survivor.	6	0	4	7	6	4.23	37	0.16
14	Lex van den Berghe	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Lex_van_den_Berghe	2	Lex was one of the contestants who felt aggravated after the beans fiasco on Day 3, saying that he could not fully trust tribemate Clarence Black. He formed a solid alliance with Tom Buchanan and Ethan Zohn. Even with a Day 13 tribe switch, in which he was switched to the rival Samburu tribe with Tom, Lex remained loyal to their alliance.\n\nAt their first post-merge Tribal Council, Lex received two votes, one of which came from Clarence. Disturbed, Lex tried to unearth the caster of the second vote. Trusting his gut feeling, he mistakenly accused Kelly Goldsmith of the "mystery vote." Lex persuaded the Boran alliance to turn on Kelly. Not backing down, Kelly switched to the Samburu alliance consisting of Frank Garrison, Kim Powers, Brandon Quinton, and Teresa Cooper. Though Kelly felt safe after joining a new alliance, the Boran alliance managed to convince Quinton to join them, effectively eliminating Goldsmith.\n\nDays had passed, and Lex's peculiar demeanor started to grate on his tribemates, especially when boredom set in, leaving them conspiring several plots to oust him. Despite having an alliance to rely on, Lex received the ire of his alliance partners when he tried to save the lazy yet outspoken Brandon over the lonesome and unpopular Frank. With this, Lex's only solution was to win individual immunity. And with three immunity wins, Lex became indispensable. He, along with the rest of the Boran alliance, managed to systematically eliminate the ex-Samburus, leaving Teresa as the last former Samburu on Day 34. Not wanting to leave without a fight, Teresa finally revealed that she was the owner of the "mystery vote" as well as turning Lex on Tom because of the latter's previous attempts to save Brandon, to possibly break their trust. Despite this, Teresa still left the game, leaving the remaining Borans to turn on each other. Teresa's last-minute moves sent the final four castaways into an uproar, with Lex and Tom debating about trust issues. Adding insult to injury, the intended plan of an all-male final three was ruined when Kim Johnson won the Day 37 Immunity Challenge. On Day 38, a stomach upset caused Lex to ultimately forfeit the Final Immunity Challenge. Kim J., perceiving that she couldn't beat either Ethan or Lex at the Final Tribal Council, decided to eliminate Lex, for she deemed that Ethan was more deserving.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Lex voted for his ally Ethan to win.	10	0	3	7	8	6.23	38	0.26

5	Sandra Diaz-Twine	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sandra_Diaz-Twine	5	Sandra returned to play a fourth time in the all-winners season Survivor: Winners at War. At the marooning, Sandra was shocked to see that her former Survivor ally Rob Mariano and his wife Amber Mariano were also competing, as when Sandra was with Rob mentoring on the previous season Island of the Idols, Rob claimed that he would not play on Winners at War. Sandra was initially placed on the Dakal tribe, which won an unprecedented Reward/Immunity Challenge on Day 1. Despite her being the only two-time winner and her history with Sarah Lacina and Tony Vlachos in Game Changers, Sandra found herself in a comfortable position as she mended fences and worked closely with Sarah and Tony.\n\nAfter Dakal lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 3, she, Sarah, and Tony were approached by Yul Kwon to target the minority trio of Amber, Kim Spradlin-Wolfe, and Tyson Apostol, as prior to the season, Kim, Rob, Tyson, and Jeremy Collins had played in a televised poker tournament, with Tyson casually suggesting an alliance if the four of them were to play Survivor together.[2] Later that day, Sandra discovered an offer for a Hidden Immunity Idol good for the next three Tribal Councils that the owner would attend in her belongings. She accepted under the impression that Natalie Anderson had made the offer from the Edge of Extinction, purchasing the idol for one Fire Token. At Tribal Council, Sandra got her way when the alliance of Yul, Nick Wilson, Sophie Clarke, and Wendell Holland banded together with Sandra, Sarah, and Tony to vote out Amber, fearing her natural alliance with Rob.\n\nOn Day 7, Yul informed Sandra that Tyson had been trying to gather numbers to target Sandra in order to get back in the majority, leaving her incensed. However, any plotting was put on hold when Dakal again won immunity. Despite the tribe's high morale, Tyson began to suspect that Nick, Sophie, Wendell, and Yul were in an alliance of one-time winners against the people with connections. Tyson tried to warn the others, but to no avail, as Sandra still believed that he was lying after he mentioned her name earlier. When Dakal lost the next Immunity Challenge, the tribe centered on blindsiding Tyson. Tony, however, approached Sandra about voting out Nick instead and keeping Tyson around a little longer to keep the target off of their alliance. While Sandra agreed with Tony's logic, she was not sure because she still distrusted Tyson. At Tribal Council, the tribe banded together to vote out Tyson.\n\nAfter the Tribe Switch on Day 12, Sandra, Kim, and Tony stayed on Dakal and were joined by original Sele members Jeremy and Denise Stapley. Despite the original Dakal having the numbers advantage, Kim, who had been on the outs of the tribe prior to the switch, bonded with Denise and Jeremy as they tried to pull her into an alliance against Sandra and Tony.\n\nOn Day 16, host Jeff Probst announced that there would be a Double Tribal Council that night, with the two tribes who lost the Immunity Challenge each voting out a member. Dakal lost the subsequent challenge, and back at camp, Denise tried to solidify a bond with Sandra and Kim about protecting the women, fearing that she was the likely target if the tribe stuck to original tribal lines. Later that day, Tony rallied Sandra, Jeremy, and Kim together to protect big threats. Sandra was skeptical about the idea, knowing that she had connections on the other tribes, and decided to sell her idol to Denise for two Fire Tokens if she would vote out either Jeremy or Tony. The two successfully negotiated a deal where Denise paid one Fire Token to Sandra before Tribal Council and received the idol, and would pay the second Fire Token afterward. Unknown to Sandra, however, Denise had already found an idol back on Sele. At Tribal Council, Sandra wrote down Denise's name as part of their plan for the idol to take effect. However, Denise shocked everyone when she played Sandra's idol and her own idol on herself and Jeremy respectively, negating the votes against her from the entire tribe and sending a stunned Sandra to the Edge of Extinction. Upon being voted out, Sandra bequeathed her remaining Fire Token to Yul.\n\nSandra arrived on the Edge of Extinction still stunned by being blindsided, ruing handing her idol to Denise. After hearing what living on the Edge of Extinction was like, Sandra immediately decided to raise the sail, feeling that the twist worked against her style of gameplay. She reasoned that she was not going to spend the rest of the game waiting for the return challenge, knowing that challenges were not her strong suit and that she had already accomplished everything on Survivor. After wishing the other inhabitants good luck and asking them to get back at Denise for her, Sandra ultimately raised the sail and left the Edge of Extinction.	4	1	16	7	8	1.73	16	0.25
4	Rob Mariano	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rob_Mariano	5	Rob returned alongside Amber for a record fifth time for the show's 20th anniversary. He was placed on the Sele tribe, while Amber was on Dakal. At the season's first Reward/Immunity Challenge, Rob and Ben Driebergen beat Tony Vlachos and Wendell Holland to earn one point for Sele, but Dakal ended up winning the challenge, sending Sele to Tribal Council. Fortunately for Rob, his target was defused by Adam Klein and Denise Stapley alienating themselves from the tribe early on. Rob and Parvati Shallow discussed their past together in Heroes vs. Villains and agreed to work together this time. After finding out from Ben that Danni Boatwright was targeting him, he confronted her, but she came clean. Rob, feeling like he could trust her due to her truthfulness, talked to her about working together and brought her into an old-school alliance consisting of himself, Parvati, and Ethan Zohn.\n\nOn Day 2, Rob was approached by Ethan, who brought up Adam's idea about targeting Natalie Anderson due to her pre-existing relationship with Jeremy Collins. Rob was open to that and considered himself the swing vote. Prior to Tribal Council, Rob and Parvati talked about how shocked they were that they were not targeted despite their dangerous reputations. At Tribal Council, Rob and his allies sided with Adam and Denise, resulting in Natalie's elimination. In the following Immunity Challenge, Sele fell behind due to Jeremy struggling to get over the barrel roll, but Rob helped him get over (after nearly single-handedly assisting his other tribemates), and Sele ultimately won the challenge. Rob however voiced his concern over not being able to protect Amber while leaving the challenge. The following morning, Rob found a Fire Token in his bag, and his worries that Amber was voted out were confirmed. He believed Sandra Diaz-Twine may have been responsible for Amber's elimination.\n\nOn Day 6, Sele lost immunity due to Rob struggling in the puzzle. At camp, Danni approached Rob about voting out Parvati. He lied to her by saying yes, but then stated in a confessional that he was not going to turn on his closest ally. Rob told Ethan and Adam about Danni's plan and that he would like to get Danni out. At Tribal Council, Rob demanded everyone to empty their bags so they could see who had the Hidden Immunity Idol; everybody obliged. Danni became the third person voted out. Sele lost immunity again on Day 9. Wanting to keep Rob in the fold, Adam told Rob about the plan to blindside Parvati. Rob relayed this to Michele Fitzgerald and Parvati and talked to them about blindsiding Adam. While Rob, Parvati, and Ethan voted for Adam, the new-school players minus Adam blindsided Ethan to weaken Rob.\n\nOn Day 11, as Adam attempted to perform damage control after being left out of the previous vote, he stonewalled Rob and Parvati when they asked him what the plan was. Regardless, Rob lied that Adam was scheming with him once again, making Jeremy and Michele lose trust and consider voting Adam off next. However, Rob and Michele pulled a come-from-behind victory in the Immunity Challenge, thus keeping Sele from Tribal Council. A tribe switch then occurred on Day 12 . Rob was moved to the new Yara tribe along with Ben and Adam, and were joined by original Dakal members Sarah Lacina and Sophie Clarke. At camp, Rob attempted to find an idol, but failed to find it. After Yara lost immunity on Day 14, Rob, Adam, and Ben agreed to settle their differences and use their numerical advantage to take out Sarah, due to Sophie being needed for her strength in challenges. Rob enforced the "Buddy System" so that Sophie and Sarah had no chance to plot, though this earned him the ire of the rest of the tribe, who did not like that Rob had to be in total control. At Tribal Council, Ben and Adam sided with Sophie and Sarah and blindsided Rob for being too big of a threat. After leaving Tribal Council, Rob bequeathed his Fire Tokens to Parvati and headed to the Edge of Extinction, where he reunited with Amber.\n\nRob managed to find three tokens during a task on the Edge of Extinction. On Day 19, Rob and the other inhabitants of the Edge competed in the re-entry challenge. Amber gave him her Fire Token, allowing him to purchase one advantage in the challenge and one Hidden Immunity Idol for use if he re-entered the game. Rob took the initial lead; however, Tyson Apostol and Natalie reached the final phase of the challenge shortly after him. Ultimately, Tyson narrowly beat Rob by getting his ball in the hole first. Rob returned to the Edge to await another chance to return to the game.\n\nRob spent another 15 days on the Edge of Extinction, but attended every Tribal Council as a member of the jury, making this the first time Rob has ever been on a jury in his Survivor career. During one effort task, he fell on one of the rocks, injuring his elbow as a result, which caused the other players to pass him. However, Rob pushed to complete the challenge despite having lost his chance at receiving Fire Tokens, as he refused to quit.\n\nOn Day 35, Rob alongside the other Edge of Extinction inhabitants competed in the second and final re-entry challenge. While Rob reached the final part of the challenge quickly without any advantage, he ultimately lost, resulting in his permanent elimination. He was the fourth member of the jury, making this the first time he would be voting for someone to win as a member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Rob asked Natalie why she isolated the others during her time on the Edge and did not compete against Tony in the fire-making challenge. At the voting booth, he said that Natalie nearly played a perfect game, but fell short because she didn't succeed in eliminating Tony. He cast his vote for Tony to win the title of Sole Survivor, which he did in a 12-4-0 vote.	2	0	17	7	8	1.93	14	0.14
20	Tony Vlachos	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tony_Vlachos	3	Tony returned to play in the all-winners season Survivor: Winners at War, where he was initially placed on the Dakal tribe. Not wanting to make the same mistakes he did in his last time out, Tony opted to keep a low profile and focus more on getting to know his tribemates on a personal level. On Day 3, after losing the Immunity Challenge, Tyson Apostol initially targeted Tony, to which Tony fired back and campaigned against Tyson. In the end, Tony joined Yul Kwon in dismantling the supposed "poker alliance" and voted out Amber Mariano.\n\nThe next day, Tony reconnected with his fellow Cagayan castaway Sarah Lacina, and the two recreated their old Cops-R-Us alliance from said season. A few days later, Sarah received a note from the Edge of Extinction telling her about a Vote Steal advantage hidden at the opposing Sele tribe's camp. To help infiltrate their camp without getting caught, Sarah got help from Tony to camouflage her via rubbing ashes on her face. Sarah succeeded in getting the advantage without anyone noticing her.\n\nOn Day 11, Dakal lost the Immunity Challenge, and Tyson was targeted for his duplicity. Tony, however, wanted Nick Wilson out because Tyson was more use as a target shield than Nick. Ultimately, Tony joined the majority in voting out Tyson. The next morning, a Tribe Switch occurred. Tony remained on Dakal with Kim Spradlin-Wolfe and Sandra Diaz-Twine, along with original Sele members Denise Stapley and Jeremy Collins. Though Tony and Sandra were dead-set on getting Denise and Jeremy out, they worried Kim would flip to the latter's side since she was on the outs before.\n\nOn Day 16, host Jeff Probst announced that only the first tribe who won the challenge would be immune, and thus there would be two separate Tribal Councils for each of the losers. Yara won the Immunity Challenge, which meant Dakal and Sele would both vote someone out. Tony was paranoid about the state of his tribe, so he attempted to reuse his strategy of spying on his tribemates to gain information. That night, he decided to join the group in voting out Denise, but unbeknownst to him, Sandra had given Denise an idol to save herself. This plan backfired, as although Denise used the idol for herself (along with one she already had for Jeremy), she voted Sandra out in return. This move left Tony on the outs, but fortunately, he won the next Immunity Challenge and lived to see another day.\n\nOn Day 19, the tribes merged into the Koru tribe, along with Tyson, who returned from the Edge of Extinction. From there, a new alliance of "lions", as Tony dubbed them, were getting together to vote out the "hyenas". For Tony, this meant low-level threats like Nick, Adam Klein, and Wendell Holland. Though the group was divided between the three, they settled on Wendell and voted him out that night. Adam quickly followed after a few chaotic days.\n\nTony won his first individual Immunity Challenge on Day 25, and he then turned his focus to Jeremy, who wanted to separate his two closest allies Sarah and Sophie Clarke. Despite it looking like Jeremy was going to go, a series of chaotic events led to Jeremy using his Safety Without Power advantage to leave Tribal Council without voting or being voted against. Tony's alliance quickly shifted gears and blindsided Tyson that night.\n\nEarly the next morning, Tony went searching for a Hidden Immunity Idol while everyone was still asleep. Although he was found by Nick, Tony managed to find the idol without Nick in sight. The next day, Tony received an advantage from the Edge of Extinction. It was an Extortion Advantage that would block the target from voting or competing in the Immunity Challenge unless they paid a certain number of Fire Tokens. Tony was excited until he realized the advantage was being played against him. Desperate to gain back power, Tony convinced Nick, Jeremy, and Ben Driebergen to give him one Fire Token each, giving him enough to pay the extortion. He was able to compete in the Immunity Challenge, which he won.\n\nAfterward, although Tony was initially set on voting out Jeremy, he decided to split the votes between Jeremy and Sophie, the latter he worried was getting too close to Sarah. Sophie was blindsided that night and was sent to the Edge of Extinction. Though Sarah was initially angry with Tony for what he did, she chose to stick with him. The next day, Tony won his third individual immunity in a row, and he later learned that Kim was targeting him. Tony retaliated by getting his alliance together to vote off Kim.\n\nDespite still wanting Jeremy out, Tony shifted his efforts toward Nick because he viewed Jeremy as a shield. However, Nick won Immunity, and, knowing about Michele Fitzgerald's 50/50 Coin, Tony decided to split the votes between Jeremy and Michele. Michele played her advantage at Tribal Council, nullifying her votes, but it was no use as Jeremy received the most votes and was sent to the Edge. This left Michele on the outs, and everyone was ready to vote her out next. However, when Michele won the next Immunity Challenge on Day 34, the majority turned on each other. Tony discovered through his spy nest that Denise wanted him out, so he in turn lobbied against Denise. In the end, though, Tony joined his alliance in voting out Nick.\n\nNatalie Anderson returned from the Edge of Extinction on Day 35, and she immediately put Tony on the spot by saying the jury loved him. Tony grew concerned about this, along with the possibility of Natalie having some sort of advantage form the Edge. He tried suggesting to his alliance that they vote off Denise, but to no avail. He turned out to be right; Natalie played an idol on Night 36, nullifying her votes. Tony and Ben both played their idols after her, resulting in a null vote. At the revote, Tony got his way, and Denise was voted out.\n\nRight after Tribal Council, Tony searched for the idol, but Natalie found it before he could. Tony won his fourth individual Immunity on Day 37, and back at camp he discovered through his spy nest that Natalie had the idol. Knowing this, Tony told Ben and Sarah to vote for Michele. However, unbeknownst to Tony, Ben asked Sarah to vote him out that night, to which Sarah obliged. The next day, Natalie won the Final Immunity Challenge, and she was adamant on forcing Tony to compete in the fire-making challenge, eventually deciding to pit his partner in crime, Sarah, against him. In a close battle, Tony beat Sarah and secured his spot in the Final Three, with Sarah becoming the final member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, the jury praised Tony for his prowess in every aspect of the game. However, Tony was also criticized, especially by Jeremy for his betrayal and broken promises. Despite Jeremy's critique, he followed Sandra in becoming the second two-time Sole Survivor with 12 jury votes to Natalie's 4 and Michele's 0.	9	1	1	9	10	4.87	39	0.23
19	Natalie Anderson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Natalie_Anderson	2	Natalie entered Winners at War as a member of the Sele tribe. After losing the opening Immunity Challenge on Day 1, Natalie immediately rejoined forces with her close friend Jeremy Collins. The two immediately targeted Denise Stapley and Adam Klein after the latter pair had ventured off on their own for a long amount of time. However, the majority of the Sele tribe chose to vote off Natalie due to her close bond with Jeremy.\n\nAfter being voted out, Natalie was sent to the Edge of Extinction, where she obtained an advantage that allowed her to exchange a Hidden Immunity Idol for one Fire Token to anyone that lost the upcoming Immunity Challenge. Natalie gave the idol to Sandra Diaz-Twine, who in turn gave her one Fire Token.\n\nOn Day 5, Natalie found a Safety Without Power Advantage that she could give to any player in exchange for one Fire Token. She gifted it to her ally, Jeremy, and received her second Fire Token. Natalie found a third advantage on Day 8 where she could sell a Vote Steal to any player for one Fire Token. She sold the advantage to Sarah Lacina, who had to then find the advantage at the Sele camp. Natalie received a fourth Fire Token on Day 10 after completing a task that required her to carry 20 logs from the summit of the island to the base.\n\nOn Day 19, the Edge of Extinction inhabitants were alerted of their first chance to re-enter the game, with some time to spend their Fire Tokens on any possible advantages in the upcoming challenge. Natalie spent one Fire Token on a challenge advantage and the remaining three on a Hidden Immunity Idol. Tyson Apostol ultimately won the re-entry challenge, sending Natalie and the other voted out contestants back to the Edge.\n\nOn Day 27, Natalie and Parvati Shallow found a clue to an advtange hidden at their shelter. Once Parvati had led everyone away from the shelter, Natalie found the advantage, which she discovered allowed her to extort any player for as many Fire Tokens as she wanted. Natalie chose to extort six Fire Tokens from Tony Vlachos, who couldn't vote at the next Tribal Council nor participate in the next Individual Immunity Challenge unless he paid the toll. Tony managed to pay six Fire Tokens to Natalie and subsequently won Individual Immunity.\n\nOn Day 29, the Edge inhabitants were tasked with transferring twenty cocounts from the back side of the island to their camp. The first six to complete the task would receive two Fire Tokens. Natalie was first to finish. On Day 32, Natalie would find yet another advantage where she could sell a disadvantage at the next Immunity Challenge to any player for any price. She sold the disadvantage to Nick Wilson for eight Fire Tokens, who paid the toll and subsequently used the advantage on Ben Driebergen.\n\nOn Day 35, with fourteen Fire Tokens total, Natalie spent her sum on three advantages in the upcoming re-entry battle, a jar of peanut butter, and two Hidden Immunity Idols, one for herself and one for Tyson. Natalie won the re-entry challenge, and upon returning to camp, she aligned with Michele Fitzgerald and threw Tony under the bus for his strategic dominance. On Day 36, knowing that Tony had an idol, Natalie and Michele placed their votes on Ben, with everyone else voting for Natalie. However, Natalie, Ben, and Tony all played their idols, resulting in a null vote. At the revote, everyone voted out Denise.\n\nOn Day 37, Natalie found another Hidden Immunity Idol. After Tony won immunity, Natalie and Michele once again set their sights on Ben, with the hope that Sarah would possible flip on her alliance. Their hopes came true, and Ben was voted out. The following day, Natalie won the Final Immunity Challenge, which meant she got to choose who would go head-to-head in the firemaking challenge. Natalie chose to pit Tony and Sarah against each other, with Tony coming out victorious and making it to the Final Three.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Natalie argued that while she may not have had the best social game during her time on the Edge, her determination led her to find several advantages that allowed her to continue to influence the game. However, she received pushback from the jury for not playing hard enough once she returned to the game, especially with her inability to eliminate Tony. In the end, Natalie only received four votes to win, losing to Tony and finishing in 2nd.	2	2	2	7	8	2.53	6	0.33
16	Ben Driebergen	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ben_Driebergen	2	Ben began on the Sele tribe. Despite earning the distrust of many tribemates during the early days by unintentionally revealing secrets and plans, Ben managed to stay in the game. He contributed to Natalie , Danni and Ethan's eliminations at his tribe's first three Tribal Councils.\n\nFollowing the Tribe Switch, Ben was moved to the Yara tribe along with Sele's Adam and Rob. While the three had their differences and trust issues on the original Sele tribe, they decided to settle their differences and use their numerical advantage over original Dakal's Sarah and Sophie. However, after Yara lost immunity on Day 15, Ben and Adam joined the women in blindsiding Rob. Yara won the next two challenges, keeping Ben from Tribal Council.\n\nAfter reaching the merge, Ben became apart of the coalition consisting of big targets, which controlled the first couple of votes. After that coalition splintered, Ben remained with allies Sarah and Tony  and developed a rivalry with former ally Jeremy, whom he then repeatedly targeted. On Day 31 when he told Jeremy to ask his ally Michele for her 50/50 coin and told his ally Michele not to give him her coin in order to create distrust between them, but when Jeremy and Michele compared notes, they realized Ben was playing them, which made Ben a target. Fortunately he escaped elimination that night, and he was finally able to vote out Jeremy.\n\nOn Day 34, Nick used his disadvantage he got from Extinction Island to give Ben a setback in the Immunity Challenge. Ben's setback was he would have to set up a 30% longer line of blocks. Despite the setback, Ben recovered and came close to possibly winning the challenge, but Michele ultimately won.\n\nOn Day 36, Tony attempted to convince him and Sarah to split their votes between Natalie, who had returned from Extinction Island, and Denise in case Natalie had an idol. Ben however did not think Natalie had anything and did not want to vote out Densie because she was his close ally. At Tribal Council, Natalie played her idol, which prompted Tony to play his, and then Ben to play his idol (found on Day 29). The vote ended in a 0-0 tie after Ben's and Natalie's votes were negated. In the revote, Ben joined Tony, Natalie and Michele in voting out Denise.\n\nOn Day 37, Ben came close to winning individual immunity, but Tony ultimately edged him out. At camp, Ben gave Sarah permission to vote him out, as he felt that his Survivor journey was complete, making the latter emotional. At Tribal Council Ben and Tony voted for Michele, but Sarah joined the women in voting out Ben. He finished in 5th place and became the 15th member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Ben attested to Tony's loyalty by saying Tony knew he had the idol but did not tell anyone. He also credited Michele's win and performance this season by telling her he understood why she won as a fellow controversial winner, and asked Tony and Michele about their drive to pull off their Immunity Challenge wins. At the voting booth, he cast his vote for Tony to win and said he was proud of him. Tony went on to win over Natalie and Michele in a 12-4-0 vote.	7	1	5	7	8	2.53	37	0.19
12	Kim Spradlin-Wolfe	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kim_Spradlin-Wolfe	2	Kim began the game on the Dakal tribe. Following Dakal losing the immunity challenge on day 3, Kim and allies Tyson Apostol and Amber Mariano became targets for being perceived as a poker alliance. Beginning to think she was the target as nobody was talking to her, Kim got emotional. Despite receiving 3 votes at tribal council, she was spared and Amber was voted out. The following morning, Kim still believed she was on the bottom, but was happy when she found a Hidden Immunity Idol. Needing to give one half of the idol to someone on the tribe before sundown in order for it to be activated, she gave on half to Sophie Clarke. Dakal won the next two challenges. When Dakal lost immunity on day 11, she considered going with Tony's plan to keep Tyson in order to keep the threats around, but at tribal council, she sided with the majority and voted out Tyson.\n\nThe following morning a Tribe Switch occurred. Kim remained on Dakal with Tony and Sandra Diaz-Twine, and was joined by original Sele members Jeremy Collins and Denise Stapley. At Dakal, Kim bonded with Denise and Jeremy. While Tony approached her about siding with him and Sandra in order to keep the threats around, she wasn't sure if that was the right move. Dakal won immunity on day 15. On day 16, Dakal and Sele lost immunity and had to go to a Double Tribal Council. While Tony convinced Kim, Sandra and Jeremy to target Denise, Denise would shock everyone by playing two idols (one of which was Sandra's, which she have to Denise), and Sandra was blindsided. The following morning, Kim sided with Denise and Jeremy, as she felt this would further her game. Dakal won the last immunity challenge before the merge.\n\nAfter reaching the merge, Kim became apart of Tony's coalition of big threats. Kim won immunity on day 23. On day 24, Kim met her kids at the Loved Ones. On day 25, Kim, Jeremy, Tyson (who had re-entered the game at the merge by winning the re-entry duel), Denise and Michele Fitzgerald decided to target Sophie. However, after Jeremy used his safety without power to leave tribal council, Kim and her allies were in the minority. After Sarah used her Vote Steal Advantage to steal Denise's vote, this prompted  Kim to play her idol on Denise. However, her idol only negated 2 votes and Michele sided with Tony's group, resulting in Tyson's second blindside. On day 27, Tony attempted to convince Kim, Jeremy and Michele that he was with them, but Kim and Denise discussed about Tony playing double agent. She wanted Tony out, but her plan was foiled when he won immunity. Both she and Denise decided to leave Jeremy and vote him out. At tribal council however, Sophie was blindsided instead.\n\nOn day 29, Kim told Michele, Denise and Nick Wilson that Tony needed to go next. Kim's plan however was foiled again when Tony won immunity. After Tony's ally Ben Driebergen told him that Kim was gunning for him, Tony campaigned to his allies to vote out Kim. During a chaotic tribal council, Tony convinced Ben and Nick to flip on Kim, resulting in her being blindsided. After leaving tribal council, she bequeathed her Fire Tokens to Sarah Lacina, Michele and Denise, and went to ​​​​​​​​​​​​​the Edge of Extinction.\n\nKim spent 5 full days on Extinction Island. On the morning of day 35, Kim and the other attendees of Extinction Island returned to the beach to compete in the final re-entry duel. Kim, however, lost the duel and was eliminated for good.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Kim joined 11 other jurors in voting for Tony, making him the Sole Survivor and second two-time winner in Survivor history.	8	1	9	8	7	1.33	29	0.28
11	Sophie Clarke	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sophie_Clarke	2	Sophie returned to play in the all-winners season Survivor: Winners at War. Initially placed on the Dakal tribe, Sophie quickly found herself in a power position as she aligned with other one-time players who were perceived to be relatively disconnected from the Survivor social scene. She quickly formed a bond with Yul Kwon, who she wanted to prop up as a "nerd-shield"—someone who would protect her from being perceived as the most intelligent player on the island. When Dakal lost the second Immunity Challenge on Day 3, Sophie and the other 'disconnected' one-time players, Yul, Nick Wilson, and Wendell Holland, found themselves with all the leverage on the tribe, and which had narrowed their targets down to Amber Mariano, Kim Spradlin-Wolfe, and Tyson Apostol as they feared that the three, along with Jeremy Collins and Rob Mariano on the rival Sele tribe, had a "Poker Alliance" after appearing in a televised poker tournament a year prior. Eventually, the tribe decided on Amber as the best option to go, given her marriage to Rob.\n\nWhen Kim found a Hidden Immunity Idol that required two people to activate the following day, she gave half of it to Sophie because she felt that she and Sophie could work well together. Sophie was happy that Kim shared the idol with her, but remained apprehensive about Kim due to her threatening reputation. When Dakal lost immunity again on Day 11, she joined the tribe in voting out Tyson, who had been throwing many names out and was perceived as a big threat due having played the game four times, as well as his connection with Rob outside the game. At some point during this time, Sophie gave back her half of the idol to Kim.\n\nA Tribe Expansion occurred on Day 12, with Sophie and Sarah Lacina were sent to the new Yara tribe, finding themselves at a numerical disadvantage against original Sele members Rob, Adam Klein, and Ben Driebergen. Despite this, the clearly fractured nature of the three men left Sophie and Sarah with options moving forward. While Sarah and Sophie were apprehensive to divulge information, the Sele men revealed their tribe dynamics and the tensions between them. When the whole tribe began searching for a potential new idol at their new camp, Sophie was quick to find it and hide it from the rest of her tribemates. Similar to the idol she shared with Kim on Dakal, Sophie needed to give half of the idol to a tribemate to activate it, choosing to give it to Sarah and leaving the two closely bonded. After Yara lost the subsequent Immunity Challenge, Rob became the target for the girls due to his dictatorial attitude and reputation. Despite Rob trying to implement his "buddy system" strategy, leaving the girls unable to confirm their plans through conversation with Adam and Ben, Sophie felt confident that Rob would be voted out. Before Tribal Council, Sarah gave her idol half back to Sophie, before the two were joined by Adam and Ben in successfully blindsiding Rob.\n\nSophie and Sarah became closer to Ben over the next few days, with Adam being their next clear target. When Adam raised suspicions to Sophie about Ben or Sarah having an idol, Sophie decided to tell the two about Adam's suspicions in an attempt to solidify her alliance with them. Yara won the next two Immunity Challenges, sparing them from Tribal Council. However, her ally, Yul, was voted out on Day 18, bequeathing a Fire Token to Sophie.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Koru tribe on Day 19, with Tyson returning from the Edge of Extinction, Sophie found herself in a large majority coalition comprised of herself, Adam, Ben, Jeremy, Kim, Sarah, Denise Stapley, and Tony Vlachos. After Denise and Jeremy won the first individual Immunity Challenge, the tribe wanted to target Nick, but Sophie attempted to drive the vote towards Wendell, fearing his friendship with Jeremy, who she perceived to be the most influential player, as well as fearing the possibility of the "big guys" coming together. She successfully led the charge in getting Wendell out, then joined the majority in voting Adam out at the next Tribal Council.\n\nWhen Tony won the next Immunity Challenge, Jeremy campaigned to break up the duo of Sophie and Sarah, although Sophie's allies wanted to target Jeremy in return. The scrambling divided the tribe into two five-person alliances: Sophie, Ben, Nick, Sarah, and Tony, with the group targeting Jeremy, against Denise, Jeremy, Kim, Tyson, and Michele Fitzgerald, who wanted to target Sophie. After more scrambling at Tribal Council, where Jeremy used his Safety Without Power advantage to abstain from the vote at the cost of leaving his allies down a number, Sophie gathered her own allies, now firmly in control of the majority of the votes, to target Tyson, who they saw as a pressing threat. With Sophie's alliance now in the majority, they decided to split their votes between Jeremy and Michele at the next Tribal Council. However, Tony, fearing Sophie's relationship with Sarah and her influence on the tribe, decided to take advantage of the majority splitting the vote and target Sophie, recruiting Jeremy, Michele, and Nick. At Tribal Council, Sophie was blindsided with her idol in her pocket. She bequeathed a Fire Token each to Kim and Sarah before heading to the Edge of Extinction.\n\nThe following day on the Edge of Extinction, Sophie earned two Fire Tokens by coming second in a coconut-carry effort task, which she used to purchase a jar of peanut butter.[3] Sophie lost the second re-entry duel to Natalie Anderson on Day 35, resulting in her permanent elimination from the game and officially becoming a member of the jury.\n\nSophie was not present at the Day 38 Tribal Council due to illness, but returned to serve on the jury at the Final Tribal Council the following day. She was among the twelve jurors that voted for Tony to win, crowning him the Sole Survivor and second two-time winner over Natalie and Michele in a 12-4-0 vote.	8	1	10	8	9	1.33	28	0.29
10	Tyson Apostol	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tyson_Apostol	4	Tyson's known connections outweighed his social game and humor, making him an early target on Dakal even in the mind of former Heroes vs. Villains ally Sandra Diaz-Twine. Ahead of Dakal's first Tribal Council visit on Day 3, Tyson mentioned Tony Vlachos as a potential target. Tony caught wind of this plan, and the tables began to turn against Tyson as his alleged "poker alliance" which included Amber Mariano and Kim Spradlin-Wolfe. Deciding to "concede the battle in order to win the war", Tyson gave up trying to push the plan and agreed to vote out Amber in order to save himself. Though that decision was successful, Tyson knew he was still the next target. Tyson attempted two plans: the first to target two-time winner Sandra, which backfired when Yul Kwon alerted Sandra. The second involved informing Tony, Sandra, and Sarah Lacina about the danger of the unconnected players (Yul, Sophie Clarke, Nick Wilson, and Wendell Holland). Sarah enjoyed Tyson's company and Tony saw value in keeping him as a shield, so it appeared to be up to Sandra, who though Tyson's plan made sense but couldn't fully trust him after he initially targeted her. Ultimately, Tyson was voted out 7-1-1 on Day 11 (with Nick, Tyson's target, throwing a split vote on Kim) and Tyson bequeathed his Fire Token to Nick as a sign of respect.\n\nOn the Edge of Extinction, Tyson found the Idol Nullifier and decided to sell it to Parvati Shallow, receiving a Fire Token which was promptly spent for a jar of peanut butter. The next opportunity to receive Fire Tokens featured four of them hidden atop of the hill, with Tyson content with finding one (though Rob Mariano found the other three). Tyson used this Fire Token to purchase an advantage in the return challenge. This proved crucial as Tyson narrowly defeated Rob to earn his place back in the game. Tyson attempted to reintegrate into the tribe by playing under the radar, and with Tony wanting to create an alliance of "lions" or higher-profile players against the "hyenas" consisting of lower-profile players, Tyson had the protection he needed to survive the first two merge votes. On Day 24, Tyson experienced his first Family Visit in four seasons, with Rachel Foulger temporarily returning to Survivor along with one of their daughters. Kim approached Jeremy Collins and Tyson about joining forces to vote out Sophie at the next opportunity as she was well connected with other players. This plan fell through when Jeremy used his Safety Without Power advantage, and following Sarah's Vote Steal and Kim playing her idol on Denise Stapley, Tyson was voted out 5-2-0 on Day 25. Tyson had no Fire Tokens to bequeath, the only instance of this happening throughout the season.\n\nOn Day 29, Tyson earned another two Fire Tokens by being one of the first six to complete the coconut effort task, which he spent on another jar of peanut butter.[5] On the final day on the Edge of Extinction, Natalie Anderson used her surplus of Fire Tokens to purchase an idol for Tyson. He cited this as the most selfless gesture anyone ever performed to him in his Survivor career. Tyson was unable to win the second return challenge, with Natalie earning the right to re-enter the game, thus eliminating Tyson in 11th place. At the Final Tribal Council he repaid Natalie's kindness with his jury vote, although Tony eventually won the game in a 12-4-0 vote.	4	0	11	7	8	1.93	17	0.24
9	Adam Klein	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Klein	2	Adam's eagerness to play with his favorite former players quickly put a target on his back. Although he succeeded in aligning with Denise Stapley on their way to the well, the two were away for too long which caused the rest of Sele to be suspicious of them. Ben Driebergen warned Adam of this development, which frustrated him as players were ignoring more obvious pairings. Adam tried to sway the tribe against Natalie Anderson and Jeremy Collins as their history in San Juan del Sur meant they were more dangerous than he was. This plan succeeded as Natalie was sent to the Edge of Extinction on Day 2. When Denise found a Hidden Immunity Idol, she told Adam about how she was instructed to give half of the idol to another player. Though she initially considered giving it to Parvati Shallow, Adam convinced her to make the safer play and share it with him. Adam would give it back to Denise prior to the next Tribal Council, where they successfully evaded Rob Mariano's impromptu bag search. Despite this, Adam still felt he had a good relationship with Rob to the extent of informing him of Adam's intentions of voting out Parvati at the next opportunity. Rob immediately used this information against Adam, prompting Adam's allies to not trust him and the other alliance to target him. He was spared by his alliance's decision to blindside Ethan Zohn instead.\n\nAdam tried to make up for his blunder by doing more work around camp. His efforts would be undone by Parvati and Rob convincing the rest of the tribe that Adam was still scheming with them. A Tribe Switch occurred just in time, but it left Adam with an uneasy majority consisting of two players he had bad relationships with at this point: Ben and Rob. Despite their initial agreement to work together and vote out Sarah Lacina or Sophie Clarke, Adam was annoyed by Rob's "Buddy System" strategy and decided to vote out the Redemption Island winner. This decision ultimately boxed him into a corner as Ben grew closer to the original Dakal women than he did. Adam's constant searching for the idol (which Sophie had found the day of the swap) would cause friction with the rest of Yara, with Ben and Adam starting to butt heads more frequently.\n\nHis lack of strong allies and reputation as an unreliable ally put Adam in a familiar spot: an easy target shortly after the merge. Adam saw through the assurances he received that either Nick Wilson or Wendell Holland would be the target as no one would commit to solely either name. Adam narrowly survived the vote on Day 21 at Wendell's expense, but Adam was not content with maintaining the status quo. He spoke to Michele Fitzgerald about a possible idol at Tribal Council, hoping to make a move using it. Following the Day 23 Immunity Challenge, Adam pushed for Sarah to be voted out due to her closeness with multiple key players. This set off a series of dizzying strategic conversations. The madness continued into a live Tribal Council, where Adam continued to fight for his place in the game and his rivalry with Ben reached its climax. Upon realizing that he would be receiving enough votes to be voted out, Adam approached the pedestal to try to pry the emblem off of it. Thinking it was an idol but unable to remove it, Adam attempted to play it. After some teasing, Jeff Probst confirmed that it was not an idol, and a content Adam, knowing he did what he could, was voted out 8-2-1.\n\nAdam was unsuccessful at any of the remaining tasks on the Edge, and was unable to win his way back into the game on Day 35. At Final Tribal Council, Adam asked Natalie what else she did besides returning to the game to warrant receiving his jury vote. He was pleased to learn that Tony Vlachos had implemented a "spy nest" into his strategy. Adam ultimately joined in crowning Tony the Sole Survivor of Winners at War.	5	0	12	4	6	2.47	23	0.22
8	Wendell Holland	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Wendell_Holland	2	Wendell's initial strategy was to ease up on the shelter building and simply fade into the background. He was recruited by Sophie Clarke and Yul Kwon into an alliance with Nick Wilson in order for the less connected players to protect each other. Wendell pushed for allies of Rob Mariano to be voted out from Dakal, contributing to Amber Mariano and Tyson Apostol's vote outs prior to the tribe switch. The switch complicated Wendell's game as he was reunited with Michele Fitzgerald, the two having a prior relationship from outside the game. Fortunately, he had the majority with allies Yul and Nick on Sele with him. Though Michele tried to be friendly, Wendell appeared to be cold toward her, perhaps in an effort to prevent them from being seen as an obvious pair. Michele wasn't happy though, and she and Parvati Shallow began to plan his vote out.\n\nFollowing an Immunity Challenge loss on Day 16, Wendell led the charge to vote out Parvati. Michele told Wendell that she would write his name down knowing there was nothing she could do to save Parvati, so that she could obtain Parvati's Fire Tokens. He was immediately hesitant because that meant if either Nick or Yul flipped, he would be voted out. Wendell also had a conversation with Parvati regarding her Fire Tokens, saying he would flip to her side if she gave them two of hers prior to Tribal Council. Not believing he was sincere, Parvati declined and instead tried to flip Nick against Wendell. That Tribal Council saw Wendell put all his cards on the table, admitting to being willing to backstab and bringing up his offer to Parvati. Parvati still declined, sealing her 3-2 vote out. Wendell's Tribal Council performance unnerved Yul, who tried to look out for Wendell. Wendell saw this feedback as a sign of Yul's fading trust in him. Wendell's talking during the Day 18 Immunity Challenge was cited as a possible reason for Sele's loss, frustrating Nick. Nick and Michele were choosing between Wendell and Yul to vote out, and ultimately felt Yul was a bigger threat, sparing Wendell in a 3-1 vote.\n\nFollowing the merge, Wendell reconnected with his friend Jeremy Collins and revealed that Nick was his closest ally. Jeremy agreed to work with Wendell but secretly wanted to vote out Nick so that Wendell didn't have another option. Sophie recognized that Jeremy was trying hard to keep Wendell out of danger, so she shifted the target to Wendell. Wendell thought that the tribe would agree to vote out Adam Klein based on what he heard about his shifty gameplay so far this season. Unfortunately for him, Wendell was voted out 9-3 on Day 21. He bequeathed one Fire Token to Michele (having received one from her following the Parvati vote) and another to Nick.\n\nInitially excluded from the core group of old-school players on the Edge of Extinction, Wendell was the sixth and final player to complete the coconut effort task and receive two Fire Tokens. Wendell proved to give Natalie Anderson some stiff competition when it came to searching for advantages, but Natalie's lengthy stay on the Edge gave her the experience needed to beat Wendell to them. Wendell came close to returning to the game on Day 35 but just came up short, ending his time as a player and officially making him a juror.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Wendell felt he had a good grasp on how Tony Vlachos and Natalie fulfilled the "Outwit" criteria and asked Michele to explain how she fared in that category. He also asked Natalie to list everything she found and accomplished while on the Edge of Extinction. Wendell ultimately gave Tony his jury vote, contributing to his victory in a 12-4-0 vote.	5	0	13	5	7	0.93	21	0.24
7	Yul Kwon	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Yul_Kwon	2	Yul described his return to Survivor as if he was "a dinosaur time bombed into the future," stating his need and intentions to adapt. Yul quickly became allies with Sophie Clarke who admired him as an intelligent player. The two were immediately on the same page as they planned to recruit the one-time players with the fewest connections (Wendell Holland and Nick Wilson) and join forces with the Game Changers trio of Sandra Diaz-Twine, Sarah Lacina, and Tony Vlachos to target the alleged "poker alliance" which consisted of Amber Mariano, Kim Spradlin-Wolfe, and Tyson Apostol. This plan worked through the first Tribal Council as that trio folded quickly, and Amber was voted out that night. Tyson attempted to turn the tribe against Sandra, but Yul immediately reported this development to Sandra. This would seal the Blood vs. Water winner's fate on Day 11.\n\nYul appeared to be in a strong position following the Tribe Switch as Wendell and Nick formed a majority with him over former Sele players Parvati Shallow and Michele Fitzgerald. Parvati and Yul briefly reconnected due to their Cook Islands history, but Yul ensured that history repeated itself by holding together his majority (despite Wendell complicating matters with his offer to flip to Parvati's side for Fire Tokens) and voting Parvati out on Day 16. That same night in the Double Tribal Council saw Yul receive a Fire Token from Sandra. Yul confronted Wendell about the recent developments, but while Yul thought he was looking out for Wendell, Wendell began to realize Yul was becoming distant from him. Wendell would be blamed for Sele's Immunity Challenge loss on Day 18, and Yul and Nick seemed ready to turn on him and spare Michele to move forward as a trio going into the merge. Yul would then talk about how to potentially get Wendell's Fire Tokens, which caused Nick and Michele to realize that perhaps it would make more sense to vote Yul out instead of Wendell. At Tribal Council that night, Yul assured the tribe that he would be willing to work with this group even if it required being voted out and rejoining them in the re-entry duel while reiterating how he wished to stay with them in the tribe. Unfortunately for him, they kept Wendell, voting Yul out 3-1.\n\nDue to his recent arrival at the Edge of Extinction, Yul did not have an opportunity to receive a Fire Token. This meant he would be one of just three players in the field of eight without an advantage. Despite this setback, Yul had a strong performance in the challenge. He did well up until dropping the ball around halfway through the maze, opening the door for Tyson to return at his expense. Yul was initially excluded by the rest of the Edge inhabitants as a newer arrival. Days later, he earned two Fire Tokens upon completion of the coconut effort task. Those tokens allowed Yul to purchase an advantage for the final opportunity to return to the game. He was unsuccessful following another good effort, resulting in his official elimination from the game.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, an apparently stage fright-stricken Yul simply offered his congratulations to the finalists and encouraged them to give it their best shot. He voted for Tony to win the title of Sole Survivor, which he ultimately did in a 12-4-0 vote.	5	0	14	7	8	1.2	18	0.28
6	Parvati Shallow	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Parvati_Shallow	4	Now a Survivor legend and a mother, Parvati played a more conservative game by aligning with fellow "old-school" winners Danni Boatwright, Ethan Zohn and Rob Mariano. Following a series of unfortunate events—such as her tribe's losing streak, the early elimination of her allies, and being outnumbered following a tribe switch—Parvati's reputation finally caught up with her, as she was voted out on Day 16 and sent to the Edge of Extinction. Although Parvati endured the hardships that came with living on the Edge, she ultimately failed to win either return challenge and was eliminated from the game on Day 35 and served as a member of the jury.	3	0	15	8	9	2.29	16	0.19
13	Jeremy Collins	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jeremy_Collins	3	Jeremy returned as one of twenty Sole Survivors competing in Winners at War. Despite losing his San Juan del Sur ally Natalie Anderson early on, he managed to work his way into a comfortable position on the Sele tribe after the new-school players took control. Following the tribe switch, Jeremy was initially at a numerical disadvantage, but soon found himself in the majority. His position worsened at the merge where his allies, with the exception of Michele Fitzgerald, flipped and joined the majority alliance as Jeremy was seen as a threat to win the game. After using his Safety Without Power advantage to save himself, Jeremy was spared at two consecutive Tribal Councils due to last-minute scrambling, but was eventually voted out at the final seven. He failed to win the second return challenge on Day 35, finishing in 8th place.	5	0	8	8	9	2.2	31	0.16
18	Michele Fitzgerald	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Michele_Fitzgerald	2	Michele returned for Winners at War along with 19 other previous winners. She was placed on the Sele tribe, which lost the opening Reward/Immunity Challenge. On Night 2, she voted against Denise, but was shocked when Natalie was blindsided instead. Despite being on the wrong side of the vote, both she and her ally Jeremy soon took control of the tribe, with both of them organizing Danni's elimination, and Michele organizing Ethan's. On Day 11, Michele told Rob about her win not being respected by fans, but Rob reassured her by saying a win is a win.  At the immunity challenge, Michele and Rob pulled a come from behind to win immunity for Sele.\n\nOn Day 12, a Tribe Switch occurred, which saw Michele and Parvati stay on Sele, and be joined by original Dakal's Wendell, Nick and Yul. She felt wary about being on a tribe with Wendell, as they previously dated. When Michele attempted to talk to Wendell, he acted rude and distant, which upset Michele. She did not know if she could trust him, as he hurt in the past. After losing immunity on Day 16, Wendell and Michele struggled to make a plan when Michele told Wendell that she was considering voting for him so Parvati would bequeath her Fire Tokens to her. Parvati was voted out 3-2, with Michele voting with Parvati against Wendell. As Michele expected, Parvati gave her her four Fire Tokens, giving her a total of five tokens.\n\nThe following day, Michele gave Wendell a Fire Token to extend trust to him, although she regretted it after he talked down to her. Sele would lose immunity again. Despite Michele's rocky relationship with Wendell, she would join him and Nick in voting out Yul for being a strategic threat.\n\nMichele reached the merge, but was shocked after Wendell was blindsided at the subsequent tribal council. For most of the post merge phase, Michele found herself on the bottom and wrong side of votes. On Day 22 she received an advantage from Extinction Island attendees Danni and Parvati. The advantage was to flip a coin for immediate immunity at any Tribal Council up until the final seven. She purchased the advantage by paying her four Fire Tokens. She gave her advantage to Jeremy on Day 29 to use. While Jeremy did not use it, he gave it back to her after tribal council. On night 31, Michele decided to play the advantage because this was the last time she could use it. She flipped the coin and it landed on safe, giving her immunity for the vote. However, she was shocked when Nick flipped and blindsided Jeremy.\n\nReturning from tribal council, Michele confronted Nick on his decision. The next morning, knowing she was a target, she attempted to get the alliance of Ben, Sarah, and Tony to turn against each other by telling Sarah that Tony would be unbeatable at the end. However, Sarah saw what she was doing and relayed this to Tony. Nick told Michele about the a disadvantage he received from Extinction Island that he could use to hinder someone in the next immunity challenge, and asked Michele to give him two fire tokens, as he needed two more to purchase it. Michele gave her tokens to him. Before the start of the immunity challenge, it was revealed that Nick used the disadvantage against Ben. Michele went on to win immunity, making this her first immunity challenge win of the season. Despite being apart of Tony's plan to vote out Denise, Tony flipped on her and Nick was blindsided instead.\n\nOn Day 35, she watched Natalie win the second re-entry duel and return to the game. At the immunity challenge on Day 36, Michele quickly fell far behind everyone else after talking a long time on the bridge. However, after finishing the bridge, she managed to dominate the puzzle, which resulted in her winning her second immunity challenge. At camp, Natalie told her that she had an idol, while Michele told Natalie that all the votes would be on her. The two discussed about breaking up the alliance of Tony, Sarah and Ben, and flushing Tony's idol. At tribal council, Natalie played her idol, which prompted Tony and Ben to play theirs. Natalie's four votes and Ben's two votes were negated, resulting in a 0-0 vote. In the revote, Natalie and Michele joined Tony and Ben in voting out Denise.\n\nOn the morning of Day 37, Natalie showed Michele the re-hidden idol she just found. After Tony won immunity, Natalie told Michele that she was going to talk to Sarah. Natalie later told Michele that Sarah saw her idol in her buff, which upset Michele. While Natalie told Michele that Sarah was with her, she was unconvinced and certain that Sarah would vote her out. At tribal council, Michele received votes from Tony and Ben, but was spared when Sarah joined her and Natalie in blindsiding Ben.\n\nOn Day 38, Michele lost the Final Immunity Challenge to Natalie. She practiced making fire and Natalie talked to her about putting her in the Fire-making tiebreaker challenge, which Michele was open to. However, she was shocked when Natalie chose to bring her to the end. Tony beat Sarah in the challenge, making the Final Three herself, Tony and Natalie.\n\nMichele, Tony and Natalie had their breakfast on the morning of Day 39. Before heading to tribal council, Michele said that she got negative feedback after her win, and now felt that the wound has been closed because she made the Final Three again.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Michele argued that she made many one on one alliances, and was able to play from the bottom. Ben gave her credit for her win and told her how she should be proud of the way she played this time. Ben also credited her for winning two immunity challenges. In her final pitch, Michele said she made great relationships, had advantages, and was proud that she played the best game she could.\n\nMichele's underdog status was, however, overshadowed by Tony's dominant game and Natalie's game on Extinction Island. She finished in 3rd place with no votes to win, losing to Natalie, who finished in second place with four votes, and Tony who won the title of sole Survivor with 12 votes, and became the series second two time winner.	7	1	3	7	8	2.47	39	0.18
17	Sarah Lacina	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sarah_Lacina	3	Sarah was initially placed on the Dakal tribe alongside her Cagayan castmate Tony. Sarah became a part of a seven-person coalition against the perceived "Poker Alliance" of Tyson, Amber and Kim. In the early days, she and Tony reformed their Cops-R-Us, with Tony assisting her on Night 8 to retrieve a Vote Steal advantage from the rival Sele camp. When Dakal went to their two tribal councils, Sarah helped her coalition vote out Amber and Tyson\n\nOn Day 12, Sarah and fellow Dakal Sophie were swapped to the new Yara tribe, and were outnumbered 3-2 by original Sele's Rob, Adam and Ben. Sophie found a Hidden Immunity Idol and gave one half of the idol to Sarah, as she needed to give half to another player until sundown in order for the idol to be activated. Yara lost immunity on Day 14. At camp, Sarah was angry at Rob for implementing the buddy system. Sarah gave the idol back to Sophie and wondered if she should play her advantage. At tribal council, Sarah and Sophie didn't play their advantages and Adam and Ben joined them in blindsiding Rob, though Sarah received a vote from Rob. Yara won the remaining two challenges. keeping Sarah safe from tribal council.\n\nAt the merge, Sarah became apart of Tony's coalition of big threats. She contributed to Wendell's elimination at the merged tribal council. While Sarah's team won the next Reward Challenge, Sarah decided to give her spot to Nick, as it was his birthday the day before and he had gotten blindsided by the last vote. However, her moved wasn't met with well reception, as Denise and Jeremy believed her decision was strategic, Tony told her she made a bad move, and Nick considered voting her out. After finding out from Tyson that Adam was gunning for her on Day 23, Sarah targeted him. Adam was voted out at tribal council.\n\nOn Day 24, Sarah met her husband Wyatt and son at the family visit. The next day, Sarah and Tony argued who to target, as Tony wanted Tyson out, while Sarah wanted Kim out for being too dangerous. However, she agreed to target Jeremy after Tony told her he was coming for her. Sophie asked Sarah if she would use her Vote Steal before going to Tribal Council, but Sarah was not sure if she would. After Jeremy used his Safety Without Power advantage to leave Tribal Council, Sarah stole Denise's vote and split her two votes between Denise and Tyson, and Tyson was blindsided.\n\nOn the morning of Day 26, Sarah, wanting to show everyone that she was fun, had a fashion show, but was upset when Tony refused to participate. That night, Sarah was shocked when Tony blindsided Sophie. Returning from tribal council, she angrily told Tony that she was done with him, but soon calmed down and warned him that she would never speak to him again if he blindsided her again. The following morning Sarah approached a tree that Tony was using to spy on people (Spy nest) and told him it was only her. On Day 29, Sarah was persuaded by Tony to blindside Kim. At tribal council, Sarah got a sense that she was in trouble. After the votes were cast, Tony openly offered to play his idol for Sarah, but she told him she didn't need it. Kim was blindsided.\n\nOn Day 34, Sarah was skeptical of Nick's loyalty, but Nick sided with her at tribal council, and Jeremy was blindsided. The following day, Michele told Sarah she had no not at beating Tony in the end, but Sarah knew that Michele was just trying to stir the pot, notified Tony. Sarah wanted Michele out for being unpredictable, but the plan was ruined when Michele won immunity.  Denise talked to Ben and Sarah about making a final three deal. Tony, however, eavesdropped on the conversation via spy nest. Tony then approached Sarah about voting out Denise, but Sarah considered talking out Nick due to his underdog story. At tribal council, Sarah and Tony joined Denise and their ally Ben in blindsiding Nick.\n\nOn Day 36, Tony talked to Sarah and Ben about splitting their votes between Natalie (who had returned from the Edge of Extinction) and Denise in case Natalie had an idol, but Sarah and Ben did not believe that she did. Sarah and Tony briefly argued what to do. At tribal council, Sarah made a speech on gender bias, and asked Jeff to start calling her Lacina. Natalie did play an idol, which prompted Tony and Ben to play theirs. Natalie's and Ben's votes were negated, making it a 0-0 tie. Jeff told Tony, Michele, Ben and Natalie that they had to revote but could only vote for Sarah and Denise, and then said if the vote ended in a tie, a now new rule would require them to make fire. Sarah was spared and Denise was unanimously voted out.\n\nOn Day 37, Sarah decided to talk to Natalie, and Tony told her to talk near the spy nest in order for her to find out if Natalie had an idol and he would use the Spy nest to catch her. Sarah met Natalie in the well, where Natalie talked to her about taking out Ben. Sarah, however, noticed something in Natalie's buff and asked to see. Natalie took it out and revealed that it was the idol which she found. Sarah then talked to Tony, and they agreed to get Michele out. Ben, however, gave Sarah permission to vote him out to help her game, which made her emotional. Sarah considered voting out Ben and leaving Tony out, in order to appeal to the jury. At tribal council, Sarah joined Michele and Natalie in blindsiding Ben, shocking Tony.\n\nOn Day 38, Sarah lost the Final Immunity Challenge to Natalie. At camp, Sarah and Tony helped each other make fire. Sarah appeared to have an easier time making fire than Tony. At Tribal Council, Natalie brought Michele to the Final Three and had Sarah make fire against Tony, with her goal of Sarah winning. While Sarah started her fire soon after Tony, she quickly got her fire burning the rope, while Tony's began to diminish. However, Sarah lost her lead when her fire began to diminish. Tony then got his fire burning the rope. While Sarah would soon get her fire burning the rope again, it began to diminish again and Tony won the challenge, eliminating Sarah. The two hugged, with Tony being distraught, but Sarah comforted him and told him to keep his head in the game. Jeff asked Sarah how it felt to fall short. An emotional Sarah said if she was to lose, she wanted to lose to Tony. Sarah then left tribal council but cheered for Tony. She became the 16th and final member of the largest jury ever.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Sarah remained loyal to Tony by voting for him to win. She was one of the twelve jurors that helped Tony become the Sole Survivor and second two-time winner of Survivor (U.S.).	7	0	4	8	9	2.67	38	0.18
15	Denise Stapley	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Denise_Stapley	2	Denise Stapley - In Winners at War, Denise Stapley and ally Adam Klein found themselves at the bottom of Sele after being perceived as a pair. However, she soon found her bearings and during the Tribe Switch, famously blindsided Sandra Diaz-Twine with her own Hidden Immunity Idol. While her big move made her a target at the start of the merge, she quickly slowed her gameplay down to keep a low profile until the final seven, where her big move made her a target again, but she escaped elimination as Tony Vlachos and Sarah Lacina decided to blindside Nick Wilson. Denise's time in the game came to an end at the final six when several idol plays resulted in a vote restart that led Denise to be eliminated.	6	2	6	8	9	1.33	36	0.17
14	Nick Wilson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Nick_Wilson	2	Nick returned as the most recent former winner. Beginning on the Dakal tribe, he found himself in Yul's alliance/coalition consisting of one time and disconnected players. Despite being targeted for being the most recent winner and a low profile player, Nick's alliance protected him, and Amber and Tyson were voted out at Dakal's two tribal councils.\n\nFollowing the tribe switch, Nick and allies Wendell and Yul were moved to Sele, where Nick found himself in a numerical advantage. After Sele lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 16, he considered voting out Wendell after original Sele Parvati notified him that Wendell tried to sell his vote to her for her Fire Token. At tribal council, however, both he and Yul joined Wendell in voting out Parvati. After losing immunity again, Nick considered voting out Yul for being a strategic threat. He discussed this with original Sele Michele. At tribal council, they joined Wendell in blindsiding Yul.\n\nFollowing the merge, Nick and Michele, who were working together, were shocked when their ally Wendell was blindsided at the first vote. Despite initially being in the minority, he soon became apart of Tony's majority coalition. On Day 29, he formed an alliance with Denise and Michele, as he felt he had a shot at beating them in the end. On Day 31, he was targeted by Tony's alliance, as he was seen as untrustworthy, but foiled their plan by winning immunity. Going into tribal council, he found himself as a swing vote between Tony's alliance who wanted Jeremy out, and Michele and Jeremy, both of whom wanted Ben out. At tribal council, Nick joined Tony's alliance and blindsided Jeremy.\n\nFollowing tribal council, Michele chastised him for messing up her's and his games, but Nick felt like he made the right decision. On Day 32, Nick received something from Extinction Island  (Natalie sent it to him), that allowed him to play a disadvantage on someone at the immunity challenge. He had to pay 8 tokens to purchase it. Despite only having 6, he convinced Michele to give him her two tokens by showing the disadvantage.\n\nHe used the disadvantage on Ben, giving him an obstacle in the immunity challenge, which allowed Michele to win. At camp, both he and Michele talked to Tony about voting out Ben, as he would be the biggest threat in the fire challenge, but both he and Michele later became apart of Tony's plan to blindside Denise. At tribal council however, Tony flipped on them and joined Sarah, Denise and Ben in blindsiding Nick, shocking Nick and Michele. Nick was unable to win the second re-entry duel, resulting in his permanent elimination.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Nick asked Tony if he thought it was fair game to do anything he could to build bonds with people just so they would not target him, and then just vote them out. He voted for Tony to win, ultimately helping him become the second two-time winner of Survivor by a 12-4-0 jury vote.	7	0	7	8	7	1.87	34	0.21
3	Ethan Zohn	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ethan_Zohn	3	Eighteen years after his Africa victory, and sixteen years after his second outing in All-Stars, Ethan returned for the show's 20th anniversary. Ethan considered himself fortunate to play Survivor again given he had survived cancer and, despite fearing a relapse, looked forward to this new adventure. He bonded with Danni Boatwright over how much the game had changed since their last seasons, and reconnected with fellow All-Stars castmate Rob Mariano. Though Ethan described the gameplay this season as "warp speed", he was part of the majority that voted out Natalie Anderson on Day 2. The game would become complicated when Danni accidentally revealed the old-school alliance in a conversation with Ethan and Ben Driebergen. Danni's paranoia and poor decision-making on Day 6 left Ethan no choice but to join in voting her out unanimously.\n\nAdam Klein approached Ethan about the possibility of voting out Parvati Shallow at the next vote, to which Ethan seemingly agreed to, but he secretly was not fond of that plan as Parvati had become a valuable friend and ally to him. Adam's continued scheming appeared to weigh on both alliances, so Ethan, Parvati, and Rob agreed to target Adam ahead of Day 9's Tribal Council. Ethan spoke at that Tribal Council about how the most important moment in his game is this moment, so he wasn't worried about the end game. Unfortunately for Ethan, that vote signaled the end of the main game for him as the new-school players left Adam out of the loop and blindsided Ethan in order to weaken Rob and Parvati's grip on the game. Ethan bequeathed his Fire Token to Parvati on the way to the Edge of Extinction.\n\nEthan struggled in the first effort task, to the point where he collapsed. He managed to recover, and with the support of Natalie, Amber Mariano, and Danni, he eventually completed the task and earned a Fire Token. This token allowed him to purchase an advantage for the first re-entry duel, though Ethan was unable to win. As the post-merge saw the Edge of Extinction become more populous, Ethan was unable to secure any more Fire Tokens and lost the second re-entry duel as well. After losing, Ethan thanked Survivor's role in saving his life by funding the drug that helped him recover from cancer.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Ethan asked Michele Fitzgerald and Tony Vlachos about the role the Edge of Extinction in their games as neither of them were sent there. Michele credited a lot of her successes this season to the Edge through the Fire Tokens and advantage she received, while Tony had the opposite experience as it sent him an Extortion and Natalie's re-entry which complicated his game. Honoring his friendship and respect for Natalie, Ethan voted for her to win, but she ultimately lost to Tony in a 12-4-0 vote.	1	0	18	8	7	1.33	9	0.11
2	Danni Boatwright	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Danni_Boatwright	2	On the Sele tribe, Danni's first strategic decision to target Rob Mariano nearly backfired as Ben Driebergen's loose lips alerted him to this development. To Rob's surprise, Danni came clean to targeting him, which earned his respect. The old-school quartet of Danni, Rob, Parvati Shallow, and Ethan Zohn would then begin working together, deciding between the pairs of Adam Klein and Denise Stapley (who were noticed leaving camp) and Natalie Anderson and Jeremy Collins (who were allies on San Juan del Sur and friends outside the game) to target first. Danni successfully voted out Natalie on Day 2, sending her to the Edge of Extinction.\n\nWhile the new-school players became increasingly concerned with Rob and Parvati attempting to run the show, Danni noticed her alliance having a conversation without her, which to her signaled that they were targeting her. Danni mistakenly revealed to Ben the old-school alliance in a conversation with him and Ethan, which visibly shocked Ethan. Danni tried to downplay it and began targeting Parvati, thinking it was necessary to save herself. She included Rob in the plan, to which Rob seemingly agreed. However, this just confirmed to Rob that he could not trust Danni, and he began rallying the numbers against the Guatemala winner. The result was a unanimous vote against Danni on Day 6. Danni bequeathed her Fire Token to Denise and headed to the Edge of Extinction.\n\nDanni earned a Fire Token during the log effort task, allowing her to purchase an advantage in the first re-entry duel; however, Danni was unable to win her way back into the game, so she continued to live on the Edge. In the post-merge phase of the Edge, Danni and Parvati found the 50/50 Coin, which was sold to Michele Fitzgerald for four Fire Tokens. In the second effort task, Danni was among the contenders to complete it and receive two Fire Tokens. However, she fell in the final heat which confirmed Wendell Holland would be the last person to complete the task. Danni entered the second re-entry duel with no Fire Tokens: and, upon losing, her time in the game as an active player came to an end.\n\nDanni's role in Final Tribal Council came at the end where she commended the finalists for their gameplay. She voted for Tony Vlachos to win the title of Sole Survivor, which he ultimately did in a 12-4-0 vote.	1	0	19	8	6	1	6	0.17
1	Amber Mariano	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Amber_Mariano	3	Sixteen years after her victory, Amber returned for the show's 20th anniversary, alongside but on a different starting tribe from her husband Rob Mariano. Her return surprised some of the players, most notably Sandra Diaz-Twine, who believed neither Rob nor Amber had wanted to play again. Amber initially bonded with Sarah Lacina and Tyson Apostol over the difficulty of leaving her kids at home to play again. Aware of how much the game has changed over 16 years, she tried to look for Hidden Immunity Idols but to no avail. When Dakal lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 3, Amber initially pushed for Sandra to go, but eventually settled for Nick Wilson due to his lack of connections. Driven by her vendetta against Rob, Sandra rallied the one-time players Nick, Sophie Clarke, Yul Kwon, and Wendell Holland as well as Cops-R-Us to target Amber in an effort to weaken Rob. Amber's allies Kim Spradlin-Wolfe and Tyson decided to abandon the sinking ship of their alliance, opting to vote against her, resulting in her elimination by a 6-3-1 vote. She bequeathed her Fire Token to Rob before joining Natalie Anderson on the Edge of Extinction.\n\nDespite Amber's best efforts, she was unable to find advantages to sell during her time on the Edge. She did earn a Fire Token from the wooden logs effort task, which she would give to Rob so he could purchase an advantage ahead of the first re-entry duel. After failing to win that challenge, Amber remained particularly close with the other pre-merge boots. She did not earn any more Fire Tokens and ultimately lost the second and final re-entry duel.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Amber celebrated each of the finalists for the games they played. She voted for Tony Vlachos to win the title of Sole Survivor, helping him become the second two-time winner in a 12-4-0 jury vote.	1	0	20	7	5	1.47	3	0.33

14	Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kathy_Vavrick-O%27Brien	2	Kathy was initially the rank outsider on an extremely tight-knit Rotu tribe. She was often seen breaking down in tears in the early portions of the game, and many of her tribemates noting she was the black sheep of the tribe, and did not quite gel as well with the rest. Due to Rotu's dominance in the early challenges though, she remained safe due to never attending a Tribal Council with Rotu triumphing in three consecutive challenges. Then by virtue of the Rotu majority in the Tribe Switch, with Neleh Dennis and Paschal English keeping her protected in both swapped tribe votes, she would make the merge.\n\nCome the swapped tribes and come the merge, Kathy came into her own and developed better social bonds with both the remaining Maraamu players- Rob Mariano, Sean Rector, and Vecepia Towery, and her own former Rotu tribemates. She also was the first to notice the Rotu Four alliance of John Carroll, Tammy Leitner, Zoe Zanidakis, and Robert DeCanio, who had been separated from Kathy, Neleh, and Paschal during the tribe swap. After the final nine Immunity Challenge, where the Rotu Four arrogantly seemed to display the former Rotu alliance pecking order by chopping down the coconuts from ropes in order of the intended boot order to come, she helped to convince Neleh and Paschal to join her in flipping on their former tribe, joining the only two remaining Maraamus Sean Rector and Vecepia Towery in a new five-person alliance. John would be the first to be blindsided, and the remaining Rotu Four members would be Pagonged during the next several Tribal Councils. Kathy did consider interrupting the Pagonging at final six since she knew if Robert was voted out, she would have a tough road to the final three between two pairs in Neleh/Paschal and Sean/Vecepia. Despite that being the case, she stuck with her alliance.\n\nAt the final five, tensions mounted at Tribal Council as Sean and Vecepia tried to swing Kathy to join them in ousting her former Rotu tribemate Neleh, stating that Neleh and Paschal were in an unbreakable two person alliance and would not take her to the end. Paschal confirmed this was true, but also countered to Kathy that Sean and Vecepia were also in an unbreakable two person alliance. Sean denied this being true, stating that perhaps this was assumed due to him and Vecepia both being black. Ultimately Kathy was torn, but decided to join Paschal and Neleh in voting out Sean.\n\nAt the final four Tribal Council, the intended next boot Vecepia saved herself by winning immunity. Knowing Kathy would be the target by Neleh and Paschal in this situation, she struck a deal with Vecepia. Kathy and Vecepia attempted to split Paschal and Neleh by voting off Neleh. Neleh and Paschal held firm and voted for Kathy, leading to a rock draw tiebreaker. In one of the most controversial events in Survivor history, Paschal drew the purple rock, while Neleh and Kathy both drew yellow rocks, leading to Paschal's boot despite receiving 0 votes both at that Tribal Council and throughout the entire game. Having made a firm Final Two deal with Kathy, Vecepia betrayed this deal when Kathy was the first to drop from the Final Immunity Challenge, making a deal with Neleh they would take each other to the Final Two regardless who won the final immunity. Neleh followed through and voted out her former tribemate Kathy, stating she knew she had a much better chance of winning over Vecepia than she did against Kathy, as Kathy from her rough beginning had become loved by everyone in the game at this point.\n\nKathy lambasted Vecepia for her betrayal at the Final Immunity Challenge and voted for her former Rotu tribemate Neleh to win. Despite Kathy's vote, Vecepia won the game in a 4-3 vote. At the Reunion Show, it was confirmed Kathy would have easily won against either Vecepia or Neleh in a 6-1 vote, losing only Paschal's vote to Neleh and Sean's vote to Vecepia.	7	0	3	8	9	6.46	38	0.18
7	Rob Mariano	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rob_Mariano	5	Mariano was initially lambasted for not doing much at Maraamu camp despite his physique but he made a strong alliance with Sarah Jones, Vecepia Towery, and Sean Rector. When Maraamu suffered three consecutive Immunity Challenge losses, the pact targeted weak link Patricia Jackson first on Day 6, while eventually turning to Hunter Ellis, the tribe's de facto leader and perceived strongest member. After Hunter's elimination, Rob assumed the leadership position at Maraamu, but it was short-lived when he was swapped (along with Sean and Vecepia) to Rotu after a tribe switch on Day 10.\n\nAfter the switch, the four-person alliance crumbled. After Sarah's elimination (she was left at Maraamu, which lost yet again), the four original members of Rotu decided to gang up on the new members because they felt that Sean and Rob took their poor work ethic at their camp, while Vecepia was castigated as preachy and pretentious. After losing the Day 15 Immunity Challenge, the original Rotu members planned to vote Rob out first, but it was their fellow original member Gabriel Cade's apathetic approach toward the game that changed their minds. Rob was spared thanks to John Carroll's lobbying, and Cade was eliminated instead.\n\nAfter Rotu's first Tribal Council, Rob confronted the original members to confirm if they had an alliance. With nobody giving an impressive answer, Rob lashed out at them, but John halfheartedly stated that they would vote Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien, Paschal English, and Neleh Dennis (fellow original Rotu members, but switched at Maraamu) first. Despite the tension, Rob led Rotu to a comeback by winning the Day 18 Immunity Challenge.\n\nOn Day 19, Rob volunteered to be Rotu's ambassador for the merge summit, where he tried to turn Maraamu's ambassador, Kathy, against her former comrades by telling that Zoe Zanidakis (a perceived friend by Kathy) was plotting against her. When the tribes were officially merged, Rob tried to throw the Rotu Four alliance under the bus by initiating a conversation about the foursome wanting to get rid of Kathy. Despite his valiant efforts, Rob's scheming sent him packing in a 7-2-1 vote (with votes coming from the Rotu Four alliance, Neleh, Paschal, and Rob's ally Vecepia).	2	0	10	8	7	5.71	21	0.10

7	Shii Ann Huang	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Shii_Ann_Huang	2	Shii Ann was selected by Jake Billingsley to be on the Sook Jai tribe. Upon arriving at the beach, she noted that her tribe was divided based on different point of views. Shii Ann immediately got into a conflict with Robb Zbacnik. Despite the dysfunction, Sook Jai won the first three challenges. At the next Reward Challenge, Sook Jai had an early lead but lost when some members broke the rules causing them to be disqualified. After losing the Immunity Challenge, Shii Ann was targeted by Robb, Jed Hildebrand, and Stephanie Dill for being annoying and weak, but the tribe voted out Jed for his perceived laziness. After winning the next two challenges, Shii Ann felt slightly alienated for being the only ethnic minority and having a different upbringing than the other members of her tribe. Jake, however, didn't mind Shii Ann and told her to not let the others get to her.\n\nWhen Sook Jai lost the next two Immunity Challenges, the tribe voted out outsiders Stephanie and Robb. When a Tree Mail said to go to Chuay Gahn's camp, everyone assumed it was a merge. After bonding with Clay Jordan, Shii Ann considered flipping to the opposing alliance. In a confessional, she stated that she felt ostracized by everyone on Sook Jai except Jake and Ken Stafford. When Sook Jai got wind of Shii Ann possibly flipping, they demanded to know where her loyalties lay, to which she responded she did not know. When the competitors arrived at the Immunity Challenge, Jeff Probst revealed the tribes had not merged, and were simply two separate tribes living on the same beach. Sook Jai lost the Immunity Challenge and Shii Ann was unanimously voted out for being untrustworthy.	6	0	10	6	7	4.71	21	0.29

16	Jenna Morasca	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jenna_Morasca	2	Jenna started on the all-female Jaburu tribe, where she aligned with younger members Christy Smith, Deena Bennett, Heidi Strobel, and Shawna Mitchell. When Jaburu lost immunity on Day 6, Jenna joined her alliance in voting out Janet Koth. When Jaburu lost immunity again on Day 12, Jenna helped her alliance vote out JoAnna Ward. A tribe switch resulted in Jenna, Deena, and Shawna remaining on Jaburu. The new Jaburu tribe lost immunity on Day 18. At Tribal Council, Jenna joined Deena, Matthew von Ertfelda, and Rob Cesternino in voting out Shawna for her closeness with Alex Bell.\n\nWhen the tribes merged into the Jacaré tribe on Day 19, Jenna's alliance now with Alex and Rob managed to control the first few votes, voting out Roger Sexton for his sexism, and Dave Johnson for being a physical and mental threat at the first two post-merge Tribal Councils. Jenna even won immunity on Day 24. However, on Day 27, Jenna turned on Deena, and joined everyone minus Christy in voting her out for turning on Alex. At the Survivor Auction, Christy outbid Jenna, winning her letter from home, but when another bid was put out by Jeff Probst, the other players let Jenna win the second letter, which was from her mother who was battling cancer. Jenna was upset at Christy for outbidding her. At Tribal Council, she along with Heidi and Alex voted for Matthew, but Alex was blindsided.\n\nHeidi and Jenna were furious at Rob for turning against Alex at Tribal Council. While the men were out working, Heidi and Jenna lobbied Christy to align with them in order to oust one of the men. Jenna won the next Immunity Challenge. At Tribal Council, she contributed to Christy's blindside. On Day 36, Jenna broke down in tears, and said she wanted to leave. At Tribal Council, she voted for Rob, but Heidi was voted out. With Heidi gone, Jenna was targeted by the men, but they could not vote her out after she won the Immunity Challenge which forced the men to turn on one another. Matthew formed a secret alliance with Jenna to take her to the Final Two. Although Jenna was interested in siding with Butch Lockley, the tribe unanimously voted him out, sending him to the jury. Jenna won the Final Immunity Challenge which gave her the power to eliminate either Matthew or Rob. She eliminated Rob due to his strong strategic game.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Jenna was criticized for her lack of work ethic and even wanting to quit a few days earlier. However, due to her stronger relationships with the jury, Jenna was ultimately awarded the title of Sole Survivor in a 6-1 vote, only losing Butch's vote.	9	0	1	7	8	4.69	39	0.23
14	Rob Cesternino	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rob_Cesternino	2	Rob was placed on the all-male Tambaqui tribe. Throughout the game, Rob made many witty comments. Like most of the men, Rob felt the men would easily defeat the all-female Jaburu tribe. He could tell that Dave Johnson was planning to play an honorable game based on his speech. That worked fine for him because he was planning to lie to get ahead. Rob was impressed by Butch Lockley's survival skills. He also didn't mind being called a "kid" by Roger Sexton. The men made fire quickly and built shelter. Rob offered his luxury item, a magic 8-ball. He stated that the only condition was if you don't ask the magic 8-ball if the tribe wins or loses challenge, because it would freak them out or be a sham. Most of the men talked about the women, namely the three young beauties (Heidi Strobel, Jenna Morasca, and Shawna Mitchell). Rob's favorite girl was Heidi. At the Immunity Challenge, the men were leading for the most part. However, Ryan Aiken and Daniel Lue couldn't cross the balance beam. This allowed the women to catch up and surpass the men. Rob and Dave also had problems with the puzzle. The women won immunity. Rob was approached by both Roger and Ryan to vote out the other. After weighing his options, Rob cast the deciding vote against Ryan.\n\nDespite having the better camp life, the men lost the Reward Challenge. This was demoralizing, but they won the Immunity Challenge. At this time, Rob wanted Roger out badly and witnessed an argument between Roger and Alex Bell about being gay (despite both men being straight). Both Rob and Daniel lobbied for Alex's vote. At the Reward Challenge, Rob learned that his "witty partay" was viewed favorably among women. The men praised him, and Rob hoped for a merge soon. Tambaqui lost the Reward Challenge, which was for toiletries. Rob didn't mind losing because he felt that the women needed it more. That night, Rob envisioned the young women bathing. He voiced also a dislike of JoAnna Ward claiming that God loves Jaburu. Jaburu won immunity, sending the men back to Tribal Council. Alex did not vote against Roger, forcing Rob to do the same. Things took a turn for the better when the men won the next two challenges.\n\nThe tribe received Tree Mail asking for its youngest member to have a night of fun and wine. Rob wanted to go, but Dave was younger that him. When Dave returned, he announced a tribe switch. Rob, along with Alex and Matthew von Ertfelda would be transferred to Jaburu. Rob was angered by Dave's decision, viewing him as looking out for his, Butch and Roger's best interest. The men made a big entrance and were welcomed by the women. The men's presence sparked Shawna back up, who had a breakdown a few days ago. The new tribe won immunity. Rob decided to make an alliance with Deena Bennett, who he felt people were least likely to have an alliance with. At the Reward Challenge, Rob only went up once and lost against Butch. Rob also made an alliance with Matthew. Matthew was thrilled because he felt that they were the next two to go on the original Tambaqui. Jaburu lost the Immunity Challenge. Alex and Shawna revealed they were voting against Matthew. Not wanting to lose his new ally, Rob and Deena decided to vote out Shawna. While showing his voting confessional, Rob described Shawna as a wonderful person because she put others needs before her own, but that's what made her a terrible Survivor player.\n\nAlex was saddened by Shawna's departure. Rob felt that Alex could focus on the game. Rob told everyone a plan to make it appear the men were sticking together, so they could divert their votes. The intended target was Dave for his athleticism. However, the target quickly shifted to Roger because of his bossiness and sexism toward women. Rob was amazed when Jenna and Heidi stripped for peanut butter and chocolate. Rob stepped out for pizza. Both Deena and Christy Smith decided to end the challenge for spaghetti and meatballs. Deena won rock-paper-scissors, giving her immunity. Rob's plan worked and Roger was voted out in a 7-3 vote. Rob and the others made fun of Roger and his underwear. He was ready to get rid of Dave because he viewed him as arrogant. Rob was teamed with Butch and Christy, but they lost. At the Immunity Challenge, Rob was the fourth person knocked out. Jenna eventually won immunity and Dave was unanimously voted out.\n\nMatthew was the initial target. However, after Alex won the Reward Challenge, Deena started to target him if Matthew won immunity. Deena approached Rob to vote him out. When Alex learned of this, he tried to recruit Rob to oust Deena. At the same time, Rob used Matthew to form an alliance with Butch. As he said, Rob was the most powerful player in the game. Matthew won immunity after Deena refused to eat the live grub worm. After careful consideration, Rob swayed the vote against Deena, sending her to the jury. In the majority, Rob, Jenna, Heidi, and Alex got lazy at camp. This irritated the others. Matthew and Butch tried to get Rob on their side. At the Survivor Auction, Rob bought a protein bar. Later that night, Alex told Rob that he would likely be the one to go at the final four. Refusing to take that lying down, Rob formed a counter-alliance with Butch, Matthew, and Christy to oust Alex. Rob explained to Matthew that he was manipulating him through the game. Matthew accepted it well and acknowledged the fact that Rob was the reason he was still in the game. At the Immunity Challenge, the tribe was given a survey. The tribe had to guess the most common answer. Rob beat out Matthew for immunity. Rob's plan came too fruition and Alex was blindsided.\n\nAfter Alex's elimination from the game, Rob started a conversation about Alex being likable but untrustworthy. Heidi and Jenna were extremely angry with Rob and his betrayal. Rob was planning to take Matthew to the Final Two. Rob questioned Matthew's ability to be beaten when he gave up a visit from his mom so the others could see their loved ones. Rob was able to see his mother, Roseanne. He told her that he was a "bad boy" in the game. Rob tried to make a finals deal with Jenna, but she was too disgusted by him to accept. Meanwhile, the girls were trying to get Christy to come to them. Rob nearly won immunity but Jenna won it instead. Rob talked to Christy about her choice, which she replied that her decision would be based on what would win the game. Terrified by Christy's swing vote status, Rob formed a plan with Heidi and Jenna to get Christy out. The women happily accepted and Christy was blindsided.\n\nRob didn't sense any animosity from either woman. In fact, both women were thankful because he saved them both. They didn't mind being told that Rob was planning to vote them out. Butch made Rob help him collect firewood, which camp was overflowing with. Matthew selected Rob to join him on reward. At this point, Rob admitted that he told every lie he could and his fate was in Matthew's hands. After eating, they returned to a burnt camp. Rob felt this was one of the worst things that could happen. In a confessional, Rob blamed Butch for the disaster. After Matthew won the Immunity Challenge, Jenna had a breakdown. After careful consideration, the men decided to vote out Heidi for being the bigger threat. The men were planning to vote out Jenna next. However, Jenna won immunity and Rob was in danger due to his tumultuous relationship with her. Matthew did save him, forming a Final Two alliance with Jenna and convincing her that Rob was more deserving than Butch for playing the game. The trio got a scale from Tree Mail. Jeff Probst later came to camp, saying that the final three would get a seaplane ride to view the Amazon. After that, they would adorn themselves with paint and jewelry for the Final Immunity Challenge. Rob finished second to Jenna in the Immunity Challenge which meant that Jenna would cast the deciding vote that night. Although she considered taking Rob because he screwed over most of the jurors, Jenna took Matthew because he was more deserving and because Rob played a very strong strategic game. Rob was the last person to be voted out and became the final member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Rob asked the finalists why their opponent did not deserve to win. Matthew said that Jenna did not contribute at camp as much as the others and had asked to be voted out days earlier. Jenna said that Matthew rode coattails and did not play the strategic game, that he did not need the money, did not care about his fellow castaways, and viewed the game as merely an adventure. Rob gave credit where it was due and cast his jury vote for Jenna, who won in a 6-1 vote.	5	0	3	8	9	8	38	0.13

16	Sandra Diaz-Twine	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Sandra_Diaz-Twine	5	Placed on the Drake tribe, Sandra proved herself to be an asset early on when her knowledge of the Spanish language helped her tribe get a huge advantage at the Panamanian village on Day 1, securing a huge deal for her tribe in provisions and food. Although she was not a force in challenges, Drake dominated challenges early on. During this time, Sandra grew very annoyed with Jon Dalton. This conflict came to a head when he wanted her to sit out for the Reward Challenge on Day 7 being a weak swimmer. She countered by stating that she was on the shore well before him. Sandra was also the first person to loot the opposing tribe, taking the Morgan tribe's tarp. Eventually, after finding the Buried Treasure, Burton Roberts proposed to throw the next Immunity Challenge to eliminate one of the weaker members. Despite doubts about the plan, the tribe went through with it. A twist was revealed that the winning tribe would kidnap one of the losing tribe's members, saving them from Tribal Council. After Drake followed through with throwing the challenge, Morgan kidnapped Rupert Boneham and allowed him to abstain from the vote. The tribe voted out Burton for his failed plan. Unfortunately, by giving Morgan momentum, Drake lost all remaining Immunity Challenges. Sandra's social status kept her safe as the tribe voted out Michelle Tesauro as she was blamed for an Immunity Challenge loss. When Sandra learned that Trish Dunn was attempting to blindside Rupert, she successfully redirected the vote toward Trish.\n\nAt the next challenge on Day 19, everyone was shocked when The Outcasts, the game's first six eliminated contestants, returned for one final shot to rejoin the game. The Outcasts won, sending both tribes to Tribal Council, where Sandra joined in voting out the increasingly volatile Shawn Cohen.\n\nUltimately, Burton returned to Drake and Lillian Morris returned to Morgan, with the tribes subsequently merging into the Balboa tribe. The Drake Alliance made amends with Burton, who convinced the alienated Lillian to align with Drake and vote out Andrew Savage, the former Morgan tribe leader and perceived biggest physical threat; former Morgan Ryan Opray was quickly eliminated thereafter. At the final eight, thinking that Darrah Johnson would be voted out, Sandra cast her vote for Jon. She was shocked when Rupert was voted out instead. Upon returning to camp, Sandra stole the fish Rupert had caught earlier but accidentally spilled the very heavy bucket. Sandra was able to deflect suspicion off her, but her closest friend and ally Christa Hastie was blamed instead. Knowing that Christa would tell everyone if she knew, Sandra kept the fact that she was the real culprit to herself. At the Loved Ones Challenge, Sandra was the only one to work to deprive Jon of winning the challenge, even as the rest of the tribe sympathized with him after he learned of his grandmother's (supposed) passing. Meanwhile, Sandra tried to convince Tijuana Bradley to betray Burton and Jon. However, the men regained the trust of the Drake women and voted out Tijuana. Unfortunately, the men later flipped on Sandra, and Christa was ousted at the next opportunity.\n\nAt the final five, while Burton and Jon were on reward, Sandra formed an alliance with Darrah and Lillian. Neither Burton nor Jon suspected a women's alliance, with Jon making Sandra swear on her kids her loyalty. In confessional, she said that she swore she would "screw [him] and Burton". When Darrah won her third straight Immunity Challenge, the women rallied against challenge threat Burton, blindsiding him and Jon at the next Tribal Council. On Day 37, Jon turned Darrah and Lillian against each other. At the Immunity Challenge, all four castaways were vulnerable due to a twist that let the jury compete against the remaining castaways, which they won. Sandra and Jon turned on Darrah for her challenge threat status. At the Final Immunity Challenge, Sandra was the first out and Lillian ultimately won immunity. Sandra stated that she would be shocked if Lillian took her to the Final Tribal Council over Jon. However, Lillian was impressed by Sandra's will to provide for her family, and deemed her more deserving of sitting in the final.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, some jurors addressed her gameplay, questioning Sandra on whether she had worked for her position. Sandra answered the jurors' questions effectively and noted that she was loyal to her alliances and worked hard. In the end, Sandra easily defeated Lillian in a 6-1 vote, only losing Tijuana's vote.	7	0	1	8	9	3.93	39	0.18
7	Andrew Savage	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Andrew_Savage	2	Andrew was initially placed on the Morgan tribe. After reaching camp, Andrew assumed the leadership position unchallenged. When Morgan lost the first Immunity Challenge, Lillian Morris informed the tribe that Nicole Delma was trying to blindside Tijuana Bradley. At Tribal Council, Andrew joined the rest of the tribe in voting out the untrustworthy Nicole over the weak Lillian. After Nicole's elimination, Andrew formed a majority alliance with Tijuana, Darrah Johnson, Osten Taylor, and Ryan Opray. Morgan generally lost challenges and the rival Drake tribe constantly looted the Morgan camp. This became a problem when Drake's Sandra Diaz-Twine looted the tarp and dismantled their shelter in the process. Andrew became upset when Osten announced that he wanted to quit after Morgan lost the second Immunity Challenge. Andrew denied Osten's wish to be eliminated at Tribal Council and voted out their perceived weakest member Ryan Shoulders. Lillian was upset that Ryan S. was voted out over Osten as she felt that Osten quit on the tribe and thus deserved to be voted out, but Andrew disagreed, saying that he did not actually quit. When Morgan again lost immunity, Lillian was voted out next on Andrew's request.\n\nAt the Immunity Challenge on Day 12, Morgan finally won after Drake threw the challenge. An additional stipulation included was that Morgan won the right to kidnap one of Drake's members; they chose to kidnap Rupert Boneham. Rupert viewed the tribe's work as poor and help them improved their camp. With Rupert's help, Morgan won its first Reward Challenge. Andrew was selected to loot the Drake camp, where he took a bag of rice. Morgan again won immunity, but lost the Reward Challenge on Day 17 and Drake sent Jon Dalton to loot the camp. Jon behaved himself at the camp, impressing Andrew, who gave him some shampoo as a diplomatic gesture. However, Jon revealed that Drake threw the challenge that got Morgan its first immunity win. Andrew was angered by the fact that Jon tried to take the satisfaction of their victory away from them. Andrew made Jon eat his words by holding 180 pounds at the Immunity Challenge, giving Morgan another victory.\n\nThe tribe numbers were even when the first six eliminated players returned for one last shot at redemption on Day 19. When The Outcasts won the Immunity Challenge, both Drake and Morgan were sent to Tribal Council to vote someone out, who would then be replaced by someone The Outcasts voted back into the game. At Morgan's Tribal Council, Osten once again said that he wanted to quit. After the whole tribe verbally promised Osten that they would vote him out, a regular vote was deemed unnecessary and Osten became the first person to quit Survivor.\n\nLillian and Burton Roberts were selected by The Outcasts tribe to return to the game, with Lillian rejoining Morgan. Andrew still shunned Lillian, making her question her trust toward them. The next day, the tribes merged into the Balboa tribe. When he lost the first individual Immunity Challenge, Andrew was targeted for being the leader of the Morgan Alliance, in addition to being the biggest physical threat. Andrew and his allies tried to turn the vote against Jon (whom he called "Little Jon" to irritate him), but Lillian flipped to the Drake Alliance, leaving Andrew to be blindsided in a 6-4 vote.	4	0	10	7	8	6.38	21	0.19

14	Jon Dalton	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Dalton	2	Jon was a member of the Drake tribe, where he was known for his frequent clashes with tribemates Shawn Cohen and Sandra Diaz-Twine. The Drake tribe ultimately threw the fourth Immunity Challenge on Day 12, causing Jon to backstab his close friend and ally Burton Roberts. At the next Immunity Challenge, which was where both tribes had to eat blended-up delicacies of disgusting foods, Michelle Tesauro, who had no trouble eating the food, was instructed by Drake to appear as if she had trouble downing the food so that Morgan would pick her for the tiebreaker, which would help Drake win. However, Michelle did not go along with the plan, ultimately costing Drake the immunity win after they picked Sandra in the tiebreaker. An annoyed Jon flipped over the camera and stated that it was what he thought of Michelle's ego and Michelle was voted out. Drake lost a third straight Immunity Challenge, and Jon, along with tribemate Trish Dunn voted for Rupert Boneham, but Trish left 4-2. An angered Rupert argued with Jon, knowing that Jon had voted for him and was so angry Rupert said in a confessional he wanted to kill him. The two men, however, made amends. Both tribes learned of the Outcasts twist, and were ultimately beaten by The Outcasts at the Immunity Challenge. Jon voted out his rival Shawn, much to his glee.\n\nJon then had a close alliance and friendship with Burton after his return to the game, despite Jon backstabbing him.\n\nAt the final seven, Jon committed the move that he would be famous for in Survivor history. Jon's friend Dan arrived to accompany Jon at the Loved Ones Challenge and informed him that his grandma was dead, and his grandma was his original choice to come to the island. Out of sympathy, the other members of the Balboa tribe (except for Sandra) decided to let Jon win reward so that he could get more information on his grandmother's death. Unbeknownst to the six of them, it was a pre-planned move orchestrated by Jon before his arrival to the island and his grandmother had been, in fact, alive and well.\n\nThe closeness of Burton and Jon eventually caused Burton's demise at the final five after the women were able to plot against the two after Burton took Jon along after winning a Reward Challenge. Jon, knowing he was the next to go at the final four, managed to save himself an additional three days by exposing that Darrah Johnson nor Sandra had any intentions on taking Lillian Morris to the Final Two and that Lillian was a jury threat due to her ability to play the "sympathy card", causing a rift between the women. At Tribal Council, Darrah was voted out 3-1.\n\nAt the final three, Jon once again found himself vulnerable after losing the Immunity Challenge. Ultimately, he was voted out by Lillian at the following Tribal Council due to Lillian being touched by Sandra's motivation of providing for her family.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, he gave his jury vote to Sandra, who won in a 6-1 vote.	9	0	3	7	8	3.86	38	0.24
9	Rupert Boneham	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rupert_Boneham	4	Regarded as the likeable pirate, Rupert began his time on Survivor as part of the Drake tribe. Upon arrival at the local fishing village to obtain supplies for their time at camp, he noticed that the rival Morgan tribe had left their raft, which contained their shoes, unattended.\n\n“\tEverything that was in their raft, I took. I've always said I'll lie, cheat, and steal to win this game. There's my stealing. I stole for the Drake.\t”\n—Rupert Boneham\n\n\nUsing these items to help boost their chances in securing more goods, Drake benefited from a more luxurious camp. After enjoying much success with their continuous victories, Boneham became the target of Burton Roberts and Jonny Fairplay after he fashioned a makeshift sarong, much to their enjoyment. Despite all this, Rupert became the resident fisherman, which kept him in good steed with the rest of his tribe, therefore he was never put up for the chopping block.\n\nDuring the events of "Pick a Castaway... Any Castaway", Boneham was kidnapped by Morgan and joined his rivals at their camp. Surprised by his work ethic, Morgan briefly flourished and came together with Rupert as the catalyst - although when he was offered the opportunity to switch tribes he rejected the proposal and became a member of Drake once again. Although he did not obtain Tribal Immunity with his original side, Rupert remained in a solid position, but after the elimination of Trish Dunn, he was upset to learn that Fairplay had voted against him, and confronted the art dealer at camp.\n\n“\tYou're starting this s***!\t”\n—Rupert (to Fairplay)\n\n\nAfter the outburst, Boneham apologized for his actions and stated that the team will be stronger after these events. When The Outcasts returned to compete in a challenge to win the opportunity to return, Drake lost, with Boneham and his alliance voting out Shawn Cohen, and then having Burton return to camp shortly afterwards.\n\nUpon merging the next day, Rupert opted to name the tribe Balboa after a small pet snake which everybody accepted. Due to Lillian Morris originally becoming outcasted by the Morgan tribe, led by Andrew Savage, she became the crucial swing vote in destroying the Morgan voting bloc. He enjoyed the next six days under the protection of Individual Immunity, but it was short-lived, as Rupert was deemed too likeable and blindsided by the former Outcasts, the remaining Morgan women, and Fairplay, finishing as the second member of the jury.\n\nRupert voted for his friend and ally Sandra Diaz-Twine to win the game.	11	0	8	8	6	6.1	27	0.41

2	Rudy Boesch	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rudy_Boesch	2	Rudy returned to play for a second time in the All-Stars season, where he was placed on the Saboga tribe. He formed an alliance with Rupert Boneham as both parties identified each other as loyal players. After Saboga lost the first Immunity Challenge, he joined his fellow non-winners Rupert, fellow Borneo returnee Jenna Lewis, and Jerri Manthey to vote out former Sole Survivor Tina Wesson. When Saboga again lost the next Immunity Challenge, he thought that his tribe would vote out the last former winner on their tribe, Ethan Zohn. Unfortunately for Rudy, his tribe saw him as a burden due to his age and, coupled with an ankle injury sustained at the previous Reward Challenge, everyone other than Rupert voted him out.	1	0	17	8	6	2	6	0.17
18	Amber Brkich	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Amber_Brkich	3	As one of the quieter personalities of Survivor: The Australian Outback, Amber's inclusion in the All-Stars installment of Survivor came as a surprise to most fans. She was a member of the red Chapera tribe, a boisterous group including Rob Mariano, Rob Cesternino, Susan Hawk, Tom Buchanan, and fellow The Australian Outback alumna Alicia Calaway.\n\nIn the season's premiere episode, Rob M. and Amber agreed to form an alliance, with Rob citing his reasoning simply as:\n\n“\tShe's beautiful; any idiot can see that.\t”\n—Rob M.\n\n\nAs part of the most dominant tribe in Survivor: All-Stars, Amber enjoyed a healthy winning streak, until Day 12, where they suffered their first loss in an Immunity Challenge. Rob M. and Amber's relationship was a matter of discussion at the Tribal Council, but Amber claimed to have come to play Survivor, not a dating game. Ultimately, the tribe decided to blindside Rob C., who was perceived as the bigger strategic threat over the more combative castaways, Alicia and Susan.\n\nThe following day, in a twist that "dissolved" the yellow Saboga tribe, two of its four remaining members, Jenna Lewis and Rupert Boneham, joined Chapera. Rob and Amber quickly fortified a long-term alliance with the tribe's two new members, one of the pair's many "agreements." The Chapera tribe then enjoyed a lengthy winning streak, winning immunity the next three times. The group did lose one member, however, when Susan opted to leave the game due to an indecent encounter with Richard Hatch.\n\nIn the season's ninth episode, a tribal shuffle managed to merely make each contestant switch buffs, with the exception of Amber, who remained on the Chapera tribe with Lex van den Berghe, Shii Ann Huang, Jerri Manthey, and Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien. Amber bluntly stated she felt screwed over by this outcome. The tribe went on to lose the next challenge and, in one of the season's more famous moments, Rob said to Lex, "You take care of her, I'll take care of you." Not knowing about Rob's plea, Amber worked hard to sway Kathy on her side against Jerri, since Jerri was not an original Mogo Mogo member like the rest of the majority alliance. Jerri was voted out, with Lex staying true to his deal with Rob and Kathy convinced that Amber would be loyal.\n\nIn the following episode, the merge occurred, and Lex was chosen to be eliminated, despite Rob's promise to "take care of him." In the episodes following, Rob and Amber managed to maintain several "alliances," including their agreement with Rupert and Jenna, an agreement with Tom Buchanan, and an agreement with Alicia. With all these castaways believing themselves to be safe, Rob and Amber proceeded through the game, eventually finding themselves in the final four with Jenna and Rupert. While it appeared Rob was the mastermind, Shii Ann Huang noticed that Amber was just as devious but managed to maintain a more pleasant persona.\n\nOn Day 37, Amber won her first individual Immunity Challenge, and she and Rob convinced Jenna to vote out her ally Rupert instead of forcing a tie. In the final three, Rob won immunity and chose Amber to continue with him to the Final Two. Facing the jury, Rob and Amber met much criticism for their gameplay, particularly because of how the power couple mixed personal friendships with strategy. Amber maintained her composure, appealing to the largely hurt jury and explained that her strategy was to work closely with someone while still making her own moves.\n\nIn the season finale several months later, Rob and Amber revealed they were still dating, Amber even wore a yellow "I Love Rob" shirt (and was booed by the audience in the process) at the Finale/Reunion. Just before the votes were read, Rob surprisingly proposed to Amber and she accepted. It was revealed that, in a 4-3 decision, Amber was the Sole Survivor.\n\nAt the Survivor: America's Tribal Council special, Amber was one of ten females from the first eight seasons to be in the "Hottest Survivor Woman" category. Amber ended up winning. She also awarded Shii Ann a new car as thanks for her deciding vote.	11	0	1	8	7	3.2	39	0.28
17	Rob Mariano	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rob_Mariano	5	Rob M. was one of the eighteen returning contestants in Survivor: All-Stars and started his second game on the red Chapera tribe. In the beginning, Rob M. quickly made an alliance with tribemates Amber Brkich (which gradually turned into romance), Tom Buchanan, and Alicia Calaway. Rob M. led the Chapera tribe into a winning streak, winning four of the first six challenges, making Chapera the most dominant of the three competing tribes of the season. When Chapera lost immunity on Day 11, Rob M. orchestrated fellow Chapera member Rob Cesternino's blindside.\n\nAfter a twist dissolved the rival Saboga tribe, Rob M. recruited the two new additions, Rupert Boneham and Jenna Lewis, to his alliance. Any strategizing was put on hold for several days, as Chapera won the next three Immunity Challenges.\n\nAfter a surprise tribe switch on Day 22, all Chapera members minus Amber, who remained with Chapera, were swapped to the Mogo Mogo tribe, to Rob's disappointment. With Amber's absence, Rob M. fortified the alliance with Tom and Alicia. After winning the next Immunity Challenge, Rob M. sensed Amber was in trouble, so he proposed a deal with Lex van den Berghe, a friend of Rob M.'s outside Survivor to spare Amber, in exchange for his safety. After much deliberation, Lex, along with the remaining former Mogo Mogo members, disposed one of their own, Jerri Manthey.\n\nWhen the tribes merged on Day 26, Lex approached Rob M. if their deal was still in effect. Much to the former's chagrin, Rob M. had reneged on his promise, sending him home. The former Chapera members then eliminated the former Mogo Mogo Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien, Rob's fellow Marquesas cast member. With the last Mogo Mogo, Shii Ann Huang immune, the Chapera alliance was forced to turn on each other. But after promising not to write her name down earlier, Rob M. swerved Chapera's votes to Alicia's direction, voting her out. Shii Ann failed to win the next Immunity Challenge and soon followed.\n\nOn Day 35, Rob won the Reward Challenge, winning himself a car and a drive-in film viewing experience to watch the original 1963 version of Lord of the Flies. He chose Amber to join him, only to find out Amber would receive a car as well. Returning to camp, Rob M. was suspicious that Tom and Rupert plotted against him and Amber during their absence, and as a solution, he pitted the two against one another. After winning the next Immunity Challenge, Tom was torn between two duos, Rob and Amber, and Jenna L. and Rupert. Rob M. and Amber assured Tom they were on his side, and they would vote out Jenna L. together. However, much to Tom's surprise, he was blindsided by a unanimous vote after Rob M. and Amber decided to take Jenna L. and Rupert to the final four, but not before leaving Tribal Council and giving Rob M. a piercing stare.\n\nOn Day 37, anticipating a tied vote between himself and Amber and Rupert and Jenna L., Rob M. lobbied Jenna L. to eliminate Rupert, stating he was a threat to win more jury votes. Threatened by the possibility of a rock drawing tiebreaker, Jenna L. sided with Rob and Amber, sending Rupert home. After winning the Final Immunity Challenge, Rob chose Amber to join him in the Final Two, sending Jenna L. to the jury.\n\nOn Day 39, Rob M. and Amber enjoyed romantic moments. At the Final Tribal Council, Rob M. was chastised by several jury members for his numerous deceptions. Ultimately, Rob M. lost the title of Sole Survivor to Amber after a 4-3 vote. Just before the votes were read at the Reunion, Rob M. proposed to Amber, to which she said yes.	15	0	2	8	9	5	39	0.38
16	Jenna Lewis	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jenna_Lewis	2	Jenna L. returned as an all-star in Survivor's eighth season Survivor: All-Stars. She was placed on the Saboga tribe with fellow Borneo contestant Rudy Boesch. Originally, she formed an alliance with tribemates Rupert Boneham, Jerri Manthey, and Rudy to target former winners Tina Wesson and Ethan Zohn. After Saboga lost the first Immunity Challenge, her alliance succeeded in voting out Tina. When Saboga continued their losing streak, Jenna L. targeted alliance member Rudy for his old age and an injured foot. Everyone joined the plan but Rupert, who had grown to see Rudy as a father figure. Jenna L. lived the next few days in safety, with Mogo Mogo's Jenna Morasca quitting on Day 9 to be with her cancer-stricken mother and Saboga winning the next Immunity Challenge on Day 12, with Rob Cesternino being unanimously blindsided that night.\n\nAt the Day 13 Reward Challenge, Jeff revealed that the last tribe to finish would be dissolved, with the remaining members being spread throughout the remaining tribes. Saboga came in last place and was dissolved. Jerri and Ethan were sent to Mogo Mogo, while Jenna L. and Rupert were sent to Chapera. Upon joining Chapera, Jenna L. and Rupert quickly joined Rob Mariano's and Amber Brkich's majority alliance. Jenna L. lived the rest of the pre-merge stage of the game in safety, never having to visit Tribal Council due to Susan Hawk quitting on Day 17 and Chapera winning the next string of Immunity Challenges. A surprise tribe switch on Day 23 sent the entire Chapera tribe, with the exception of Amber, to Mogo Mogo. The new Mogo Mogo tribe won the next Immunity Challenge, ensuring all of its members would make the merge.\n\nUpon merging, Jenna L. stuck with Rob M.'s alliance and voted out Mogo Mogo Alliance members Lex van den Berghe and Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien. When the last remaining original Mogo Mogo member, Shii Ann Huang, won immunity, Jenna L. voted with Rob M. in blindsiding Alicia Calaway. When Shii Ann failed to win the next immunity, Jenna L. and the rest of the tribe voted her out. At the final five, Tom Buchanan became the swing vote between Jenna L.'s alliance with Rupert and Rob M.'s alliance with Amber. Instead of allowing Tom to be the swing vote, Rob M. and Amber voted to take Jenna L. and Rupert to the final four and blindside Tom instead.\n\nWhen Amber won the final four Immunity Challenge, Jenna L. became the crucial swing vote between her newer alliance with Rob M. and original alliance with Rupert. Not willing to put her fate in the hands of a potential rock drawing tiebreaker, she betrayed her former ally and Rupert was voted out. After losing the Final Immunity Challenge, Jenna L.'s fate would be determined by Rob M. that night. Unfortunately for Jenna L., Rob M. voted her out as his alliance with Amber was stronger than his alliance with Jenna L. and he believed she would win if she made it to the Final Two.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Jenna L. congratulated the finalists and asked what they would do with the money if they won. Rob M. claimed he would use the money for a basketball college scholarship fund. Amber said she would use the money to fund a charity for muscular dystrophy. Jenna respected Rob M.'s aggressive gameplay over Amber's, so she voted for him to win, even though Amber won the season.	8	0	3	7	8	2.73	38	0.21
15	Rupert Boneham	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rupert_Boneham	4	Rupert returned for the following season, Survivor: All-Stars, becoming the first person in Survivor history to play in consecutive seasons. He was placed on the yellow Saboga tribe. Early on, Rupert made a strong alliance with Rudy Boesch, seeing him as a father figure. Both pairs of Jenna Lewis/Jerri Manthey and Ethan Zohn/Tina Wesson relied on Rupert's vote to vote off either Jenna or Tina at the ensuing Tribal Council. Both of them joined Jenna L.'s alliance to get rid of the past winners Tina and Ethan. At the first Tribal Council on Day 3, their alliance successfully voted out Tina. \n\nSaboga continued losing, attending the second Tribal Council. Although the original plan was to eliminate Ethan, the alliance targeted Rudy for his weakness and injured foot. Rupert pleaded to the alliance to vote out Ethan, refusing to vote for Rudy. Unfortunately for Rupert, the rest of the alliance and Ethan decided Rudy was too much of a burden and he was blindsided in a 3-2 vote.\n\nSaboga remained safe when Mogo Mogo member Jenna Morasca quit the game on Day 9 to hurry home to be with her cancer-stricken mother. On Day 12, Saboga finally won immunity keeping Rupert safe for another three days with Rob Cesternino being voted out. After the Day 13 Reward Challenge, Saboga was dissolved. Rupert and Jenna L. were sent to Chapera, while Jerri and Ethan joined Mogo Mogo. Rupert and Jenna L. quickly joined Rob Mariano and Amber Brkich's alliance.\n\nWhile on Chapera, Rupert did not have to visit Tribal Council, only losing a member on Day 17 when Susan Hawk quit. Rupert enjoyed safety throughout the pre-merge stage of the game. On Day 23, the tribes expected a merge, but were shocked when Jeff Probst revealed a tribe switch. Rupert, along with four other members of the Chapera tribe, were switched to Mogo Mogo and won the sole switched Immunity Challenge.\n\nAfter the two tribes merged into Chaboga Mogo, Rupert stuck with Rob's alliance and eliminated Lex van den Berghe and Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien in the first two Tribal Councils. On Day 30, after the intended target Shii Ann Huang won immunity, Rob convinced his alliance to vote out Alicia Calaway. When Shii Ann failed to win the next Immunity Challenge, Rupert voted with his alliance and eliminated her.\n\nAt the final five, Tom Buchanan became the swing vote between Rupert and Jenna L.'s alliance and Rob M. and Amber's alliance. Not wanting to let Tom be the swing vote, Tom was blindsided when Rob M. and Amber voted to take Rupert and Jenna L. to the final four. When Amber won the final four Immunity Challenge, Rob and Amber aimed to vote out Rupert, while Rupert aimed to eliminate Rob M., leaving Jenna L. with the deciding vote. Terrified that she would be ousted by a rock draw if she voted against Rob M., Jenna L. decided to vote with Rob M. and Amber which sent Rupert to the jury in a 3-1 vote.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Rupert asked the finalists what they did to make it to the Final Two and why he should vote for them. Amber said it was by playing the game day by day. She stated she had she many obstacles like the tribe switch and had never lost focus. Rob M. said that Rupert was a man of his word. Rupert chuckled and thanked the finalists. In the end, Rupert respected Rob M.'s game play more than Amber's so he cast his jury vote for Rob M. to win, even though Amber won in a 4-3 vote.\n\nAt the finale of All-Stars, viewers were given the opportunity in a fan vote dubbed, Survivor: America's Tribal Council, to select one of the eighteen contestants to win $1 million. The finalists were Rupert Boneham, Colby Donaldson, Tom Buchanan, and Rob Mariano. Rupert won the $1 million, receiving 85% of the 38 million votes cast. He spent his prize money on his family's debts, a college fund for his daughter, a new house for his family, and the creation of his charity, Rupert's Kids, which mentors troubled children.	10	0	4	8	7	3.93	37	0.27
13	Shii Ann Huang	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Shii_Ann_Huang	2	Shii Ann was invited back for Survivor: All-Stars and was placed on the Mogo Mogo tribe. Shii Ann was impressed by Richard Hatch's survival skills, especially when he caught a shark. Mogo Mogo generally placed second in challenges, keeping Shii Ann away from Tribal Council. However, despite the early winning streak, Jenna Morasca feared her mother would die while she was in the competition and pulled herself from the game. Jenna's actions left everyone on Mogo Mogo saddened that they lost a member of the tribe. Mogo Mogo came in second at the next Immunity Challenge, meaning Shii Ann was safe again.\n\nThe next day, the tribe was given supplies to build a raft. At the challenge, it was revealed that the tribe that finished in last would be dissolved and its members would be scattered among the two winning teams. Mogo Mogo came in first and discussed who to pick. When it came time to pick from the former Sabogas, Mogo Mogo chose Ethan Zohn and Jerri Manthey to become Mogo Mogos. Chapera won the Immunity Challenge, sending Shii Ann to her first Tribal Council of the season. Ethan was the intended target, but Colby Donaldson wanted Richard out. In response to this, Richard attempted to recruit the women to form a counter-alliance. Shii Ann, Jerri, and Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien sided with booting Richard. At the next challenge, Susan Hawk who was increasingly irritated by her indecent exposure with Richard at the last challenge started to yell. Jeff Probst and Shii Ann tried to calm her down, but Susan got more angry. Susan had an outburst of all of her pent-up rage and quit the game. The challenge became a Reward Challenge, which Mogo Mogo won. However, they were still disturbed by Susan's rant, which included them in her hatred. Chapera won all challenges afterward. After the first loss, Chapera kidnapped Kathy, preventing her from voting. Shii Ann became the swing vote between Colby (who annoyed her about her gameplay) or Jerri (who Shii Ann was equally annoyed with for her personality and poor work ethic). Shii Ann ultimately chose to vote out Colby for being the bigger threat. At the next vote, Ethan was unanimously voted out for being the last winner in the game.\n\nWhen the next Tree Mail came, the four Mogo Mogos received bottles of paint and a note hinting a merge. The tribe didn't paint themselves with it due to lack of specific instruction. Things took a turn when the tribes were revealed to be switching instead of merging. Shii Ann and all of her Mogo Mogo tribemates became Chapera. Amber Brkich stayed on Chapera and acted like a hostess. The newcomers were impressed by how well-kept the Chapera camp was and noted that they could have improved the Mogo Mogo more. The new tribe got Tree Mail, that implied the challenge was trivia from past seasons. The assumption was right. The tribes were even but the new Chapera faltered at the last question, giving the new Mogo Mogo the immunity win. Rob Mariano came to Lex van den Berghe, pleading him to spare Amber. In return, he would protect him. Shii Ann wanted Amber gone, but didn't vote her because she did not want to deal with Rob's wrath. She voted out Jerri in a unanimous vote.\n\nThe tribes merged and moved to the abandoned Saboga camp. Rob went back on his deal with Lex, who even Shii Ann voted against at the Tribal Council of the merged tribe. At the next challenge, the tribes were divided into teams of four. The winning team would get letters from home and a chance at individual immunity. Shii Ann's team which consisted of Amber, Rob, and Alicia Calaway won. However, Shii Ann failed to win immunity. Kathy and Shii Ann tried to break the Chapera Alliance, however, the alliance stayed strong and voted out Kathy. Disheartened by losing the person she was closest to throughout the game, Shii Ann was fully aware that she was the next to go. This was made more apparent when Rupert Boneham won the Reward Challenge and left her with just a bowl of rice. At the Immunity Challenge, Shii Ann outlasted Rupert to win immunity. Despite the immunity win, the others still ostracized her with Alicia warning her to not get cocky with her win as she had to return to camp with them. Back at camp, Shii Ann viewed them as stupid players for not making deals with her. Amber told the others to let Shii Ann enjoy her moment. Knowing that Rob, Alicia, and Rupert were all vulnerable, she decided to vote against Alicia who was voted out unanimously.\n\nShii Ann felt alienated being with the other five. Shii Ann, in particular, was getting annoyed with Jenna Lewis. The next Reward Challenge was a Loved Ones Challenge. The loved ones would be the ones competing in an eating challenge. Shii Ann saw her mother, Lily. Lily was out in the second round. Shii Ann didn't mind her mom losing, knowing the food was disgusting and the living conditions were horrible. At the Immunity Challenge, she came very close to winning, but Tom Buchanan beat her to immunity. Unable to break the Chapera bond, Shii Ann was unanimously voted out.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Shii Ann asked the finalists three reasons why should she vote for the other one. Rob said that Amber was the truest partner in the game, she never quit, and for her support towards the alliance. Amber said that Rob should win because of his challenge performance, he was the person she could depend on, and for sticking to the alliance. Ultimately, Shii Ann gave her jury vote to Amber. She stated the person who she voted for would win the million dollars. The was proven true as Amber became the Sole Survivor of Survivor: All-Stars. At the All-Stars Reunion Show, believing she was the swing vote, Amber gave Shii Ann a car for voting for her.	8	0	6	7	8	2.85	33	0.24
12	Alicia Calaway	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Alicia_Calaway	2	Because of her memorable personality and actions, Alicia was invited back for All-Stars. Alicia was initially placed on the Chapera tribe. Because the tribe only received a machete, Alicia focused on making a fire to boil water. However, Amber Brkich and Rob Mariano wanted to improve the shelter after a horrid first night. Alicia and Rob M. clashed over priorities, leaving them annoyed with one another. At the first Immunity Challenge, it was revealed that there were three tribes; Chapera came in first, followed by Mogo Mogo. Tree Mail on Day 4 came with a locked box. Host Jeff Probst explained at the Reward Challenge that the box could only be opened with three keys, which the tribes would receive by winning Reward Challenges. Saboga won the subsequent challenge, but elected to give up their reward so everyone can have flint. Back at camp, Rob M. and Tom Buchanan wanted to make fire, but Alicia took over herself and succeeded, though this did not change Rob M.'s opinion of her.\n\nTree Mail on Day 7 had a toolbox and a note that implied the challenge was building the best shelter. While Rob M. and Tom built the shelter, Alicia and Rob Cesternino worked on the shelter's aesthetics, but Rob C.'s lack of work ethic annoyed everyone, and Alicia made him gather more rocks. When the judge came, he was highly impressed by the shelter. Later, a crate was dropped from the sky, signifying that Chapera had come in first. In addition to a clue to opening the lockbox, the tribe won pillows, blankets, a tarp, and wine. The tarp and parachute came in handy due to a heavy rainstorm that came later that night. At the Immunity Challenge on Day 11, Alicia served as the caller for Chapera. Despite gaining all of their puzzle pieces first, Chapera faltered at the puzzle and lost the challenge. Although in danger because of her mouth, Alicia was spared and Rob C. was voted out due to being feared as a strategic threat after the merge.\n\nAt the Reward Challenge on Day 13, Jeff revealed that last-place tribe would be dissolved. Chapera came in second and was left intact, while the Saboga tribe was dissolved; Rupert Boneham and Jenna Lewis then became members of Chapera. Although Chapera won the Immunity Challenge, Richard Hatch accidentally touched Susan Hawk while naked. Susan became increasingly fixated on the incident. Alicia tried to comfort her, but had a hard time doing so. This would cause Susan to quit the game at the next challenge. The tribe had a moment of silence for Susan but carried on like normal. Alicia was disturbed that she was the only one concerned that the tribe lost a tough tribe member. Nevertheless, Chapera emerged as a dominant force in challenges over the next few days.\n\nOn Day 22, the tribes received Tree Mail with a note heavily implying a merge. When the tribes met, Alicia was paired with Mogo Mogo's Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien. When they returned, everyone was expecting a merge. Instead of the merge, however, it was revealed to be a surprise tribe switch. Alicia, Jenna L., Rob. M., Rupert, and Tom became the new Mogo Mogo, with their former tribemate Amber being the only one left on Chapera with former Mogo Mogo members Kathy, Jerri Manthey, Lex van den Berghe, and Shii Ann Huang. Although the new Mogo Mogo won the next Immunity Challenge, they viewed the victory as bittersweet due to the likely elimination of Amber. On their way out of the challenge, Rob M. told Lex that if he protected Amber, then Rob M. would protect him. Back at camp, Rob M. aligned with Alicia as a back-up in case Amber was voted out. At the Reward Challenge, Mogo Mogo was joyous to see that Amber somehow survived.\n\nThe next time the tribes met on Day 26, the castaways had to drop their buffs again, this time finally merging into the Chaboga Mogo tribe. At the the tribe's first Tribal Council, Rob M. turned the vote against Lex, who was furious at Rob M. for not owning up to the deal that they had made. After Rob M. won the next Immunity Challenge, the remaining members of the Mogo Mogo Alliance, Kathy and Shii Ann, scrambled, pointing out that Alicia and Tom would be the first two to go and that Amber, Jenna L., and Rob M. would be the final three if things did not change. Chapera stayed strong, however, and Kathy was voted out next.\n\nAt the next Reward Challenge, the reward was revealed to be that everyone would go to a restaurant and the winner would decide the order that everyone would get to pick their meal. Alicia was the third out, with Rupert eventually winning the challenge. After the challenge, Alicia was upset because of the unflattering responses of her. The other women tried consoling her, but she did not want to hear it. That night at the restaurant, Rupert himself, Jenna L., Amber, and Rob M. picked the best four items, with Alicia allowed to pick fifth. Back at camp, Alicia talked with Tom about sticking together and who to vote out. When Shii Ann won immunity, Alicia assumed the original Chapera would stick together and vote out Rupert. However, Rob M. turned the vote against her, and Alicia was unanimously voted out.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Alicia told Amber and Rob M. that they had mastered butt kissing and ego stroking. She then stated that, while they may have outwitted, outplayed, and outlasted the jury, that they had not outclassed them. Alicia asked them to describe how they played the game in one word. Rob M. answered "competitive", while Amber said "with luck." Because of Amber's answer, and the fact she was angry that Rob M. broke their alliance, Alicia voted for Amber to win, which she did in a 4-3 vote.	11	0	7	7	6	2.25	30	0.37
11	Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kathy_Vavrick-O%27Brien	2	Kathy returned to Survivor as part of the Mogo Mogo tribe, which found itself divided from the start, as the men and women immediately plotted against one another. After a brief meeting, the tribe agreed to set politicking aside and focus on winning challenges. For the first twelve days, Kathy was in no immediate danger as Mogo Mogo routinely finished second at Immunity Challenges.\n\nOn Day 13, a high-stakes Reward Challenge was held, with the last placing tribe to be absorbed by the other two tribes. Mogo Mogo finished first, and chose to take in Ethan Zohn and Jerri Manthey from the dissolved Saboga tribe as new tribe members. Two days later, Kathy and the rest of Mogo Mogo suffered her first immunity loss; and while it would seem the tribe was united enough to continue the ongoing trend of voting out former winners (in this case, Ethan), Kathy and Shii Ann Huang were approached by Lex van den Berghe, who proposed an idea to vote out their tribe's former winner, Richard Hatch, who was perceived as the biggest competition by virtue of being the first Survivor winner. Kathy found herself in the middle all afternoon between two blocs: Hatch and the women who agreed to vote out Colby Donaldson, and the men, who wanted Hatch gone. Ultimately, Kathy and the Mogo Mogo tribe unanimously voted Richard out.\n\nKathy joined a separate women's alliance consisting of herself, Shii Ann, and Jerri along with being in the main alliance with Lex. The women planned to vote off Colby first for his mistreatment of Jerri in their first season. Later, Jerri convinced Lex to join the women's alliance. When Mogo Mogo lost the Immunity Challenge on Day 19, Kathy was kidnapped by Chapera. She felt very accepted by Chapera and was surprised at the easy going nature of the tribe, in comparison to Mogo Mogo's serious nature. Since Kathy was at Chapera she skipped the Tribal Council where Colby was voted out.\n\nWhen Kathy returned to Mogo Mogo, she was saddened because her small break from her tribe was over. After receiving Tree Mail saying that the tribe had to send a member from Mogo Mogo to Chapera. Kathy was selected because she had already formed a bond with the tribe. Once again Kathy had a great time at Chapera. Kathy returned to Mogo Mogo after the Reward Challenge. Mogo Mogo failed to win the Immunity Challenge sending Kathy to Tribal Council again. Kathy's alliance targeted Ethan for being the only outsider of the tribe and for being a former winner. Although Ethan was the easy choice, Kathy was approached by Ethan to form a counter alliance and vote out Jerri. At Tribal Council Kathy stuck with her original alliance and Ethan was voted off.\n\nOn Day 23, the tribes met with Mogo Mogo and Chapera expecting a merge. Jeff asked the castaways to pair up and have a private chat with one-another. Kathy was paired up with Alicia Calaway. Jeff later revealed that the tribes were not merging, instead they were switching. Kathy, along with all the remaining Mogo Mogo members were all switched to Chapera. Amber Brkich was the only new member on the tribe. Chapera celebrated when they reached their new campsite. The new Chapera tribe lost the Immunity Challenge and while leaving the challenge Lex struck a deal with Mogo Mogo member, Rob Mariano to save Amber. The tribe went along with Lex's idea and targeted Jerri. Kathy went along with Lex's plan to vote out Jerri and Jerri was voted out at Tribal Council.\n\nThe tribes merged on Day 26 into the Chaboga Mogo tribe. Kathy assumed she was in a good place in the game, having a previous bond with the members of Mogo Mogo and having made a deal with Rob. Kathy won the first individual Immunity Challenge. When Rob revealed he planned on betraying Lex, Kathy considered giving Immunity to Lex to save him but possibly eliminate herself, but Lex told her no and to keep her immunity. At Tribal Council, Kathy decided to keep her immunity so Lex was voted out. Kathy then became a target due to her being one of the last remaining original Mogo Mogo members. At the Reward Challenge, Kathy was teamed up with Jenna Lewis, Rupert Boneham, and Tom Buchanan. Kathy's team lost, which also prevented her from competing for immunity. Rob gave up his reward so everyone else can have theirs. Kathy wondered if the move was strategic or from pure kindness. Kathy warned the lower members of the Chapera Alliance to come with Mogo Mogo or be picked off. Kathy's lobbying failed and she was voted out 6-2.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Kathy was the second person to speak. Kathy reminded Rob on how after Marquesas he was worried about how he was going to be perceived. Her question to him was what will people think of him after he used and killed friendships to get to a place, where is that place and is he concerned about this. Rob admitted to abusing friendships and was worried about it, but he didn't know where that place was. Rob also claimed he was not a malicious person and would not intentionally hurt anybody. Kathy then asked Amber if she was playing Rob and if she won, and would she continue her relationship with him in real life. Amber admitted that she was initially flirting with Rob as strategy. However, as the game continued, she did develop genuine feelings for him and would hope to continue their relationship. Kathy then gave an emotional heartfelt speech about how Rob crushed her severely and that the finalists could have taken a different way that would not have left the jury as hurt as they are now. Kathy voted for Rob to win, reasoning that their friendship was still there, even if it had been fractured. However, he lost to Amber by one vote 4-3.	7	0	8	8	7	3	28	0.25
10	Lex van den Berghe	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Lex_van_den_Berghe	2	Lex started the game on the Mogo Mogo tribe. He formed close bonds with Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien and Shii Ann Huang, most notably Kathy. Losing Jenna Morasca due to her decision to quit, Mogo Mogo was immune for the first four eliminations. At the next Reward Challenge, the losing tribe would be dissolved into the two remaining tribes. Saboga lost the challenge, and Ethan Zohn and Jerri Manthey were sent to Mogo Mogo. After losing the Immunity Challenge, Lex and his allies voted off Richard.\n\nThe new Mogo Mogo tribe continued its losing streak, and Lex approached Jerri about forming an alliance and blindsiding Colby. Jerri was all for it, wanting revenge on Colby from her previous season. He then told Kathy and Shii Ann of the plan. At Tribal Council, Colby was blindsided, and only Ethan voted with him. Continuing their losing streak, Lex broke the news to his friend Ethan that he would be the target at the next Tribal Council. Ethan was upset and asked Lex to vote off Jerri who was less useful in challenges and at camp, but Lex viewed her as an easily controllable pawn. Ethan was still voted off.\n\nA surprising second tribal swap occurred, and the Mogo Mogo tribe was switched to Chapera while Chapera was switched to Mogo Mogo. Only Amber Brkich remained on her original tribe Chapera, which put her on the outside of Lex, Kathy, Shii Ann, and Jerri. After the new Mogo Mogo tribe won immunity, Rob Mariano caught Lex after the challenge and told him that he would take care of him during the merge if he could save Amber at Tribal Council. Lex and Kathy debated keeping Amber or Jerri, and eventually decided to vote Jerri, a loyal ally, out for fear of Rob's wrath and hoping to get further in the game.\n\nChapera and Mogo Mogo merged, and Rob M. was overjoyed to see Amber still around. At the Immunity Challenge, one man and one woman were eligible to win; Rob M. and Kathy won. Before Tribal Council, Rob sat down with Lex and Kathy and told Lex that he would be going home that night at Tribal Council. Lex was furious with Rob and argued with him over friendship and promises, which eventually made Kathy cry. She told Lex she would give him her necklace, but he wanted her to keep it. Rob M. committed to his betrayal of Lex and made him the first juror.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Lex delivered a fiery polemic towards Rob M. and Amber, saying that the money they win will not buy back the friendships they crushed along the way. He voted for Amber to win out of spite against Rob M.	6	0	9	7	8	3.1	27	0.22
14	Tom Buchanan	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Buchanan	2	Tom returned to compete in Survivor: All-Stars where he was initially placed on the Chapera tribe and aligned early on with the existing alliance of Amber Brkich and Rob Mariano. With Rob M. leading the Chapera Alliance, Tom was able to play a quiet game and avoid making enemies, save for Susan Hawk. However, after Susan quit the game on Day 17, Tom celebrated by dancing and singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead".\n\nOn Day 13, a tribe dissolve occurred, bringing original Saboga members Jenna Lewis and Rupert Boneham into the tribe, with Amber and Rob M. also forming an alliance with them. After the Chapera Alliance had successfully voted out all of the other competitors and made it to the final five, Rob M. worried that Tom would side with Jenna L. and Rupert, which caused him to instigate a fight between Tom and Rupert. Tom then sided with Amber and Rob M. and targeted Jenna L. at the next Tribal Council. However, Amber and Rob M. voted to take Jenna L. and Rupert to the final four and voted out Tom on Day 36.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Tom, angry over Rob M.'s betrayal, pretended to hold out his hand and when Rob M. was about to shake it, Tom pulled his hand back and snapped "Don't be stupid, stupid." To get even with Rob, Tom voted for Amber to win, which she did in a 4-3 vote. However, Tom eventually forgave Rob M. at the Reunion Show.	12	0	5	7	8	2.29	36	0.33
8	Ethan Zohn	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ethan_Zohn	3	Originally part of the Saboga tribe, Ethan was immediately targeted as a previous winner, along with Survivor: The Australian Outback winner Tina Wesson. When Saboga lost immunity, the rest of the tribe decided to vote out Tina first, needing Ethan's strength to win future challenges. When Saboga lost immunity once again, Ethan was spared once more over physical liability Rudy Boesch, who had hurt his ankle at the Reward Challenge.\n\nOn Day 13, Ethan and the rest of the Saboga tribe were disbanded after losing a challenge. Ethan and Jerri Manthey joined the Mogo Mogo tribe, while Jenna Lewis and Rupert Boneham joined Chapera. Later in that episode, Ethan joined the rest of his new tribe to vote out Survivor: Borneo winner Richard Hatch. With Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien kidnapped by Chapera, Ethan joined forces with Colby Donaldson to oust Jerri. Unfortunately for Ethan, Shii Ann Huang voted against Colby, causing his demise. On the outs, Ethan begged Lex to honor their friendship by keeping him over the unpopular Jerri. Despite this, he was the last of the former winners to take the fall, though he was the most successful of the four previous winners who competed on All-Stars, lasting longer than Tina, Richard, and Jenna Morasca did.\n\nEthan was nominated in Survivor: America's Tribal Council as Sexiest Male, but lost to Colby Donaldson.	4	0	11	8	7	2.63	21	0.19
6	Susan Hawk	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Susan_Hawk	2	Susan was one of 18 previous castaways who returned for Survivor: All-Stars. Being a member of the dominant Chapera tribe, Susan enjoyed a long winning streak, although she was targeted by her tribemates for being opinionated and lonesome. Despite this, she managed to survive Chapera's first Tribal Council on Day 12. After a game-changing twist, where a rival tribe Saboga lost a particular Reward Challenge, their members were transferred to Chapera and to the other opposing tribe Mogo Mogo. Chapera chose Rupert Boneham and Susan's fellow Borneo castmate Jenna Lewis to join the tribe, much to Susan's delight.\n\nSusan's confidence was completely shattered during the following Immunity Challenge, where they were to traverse a series of balance beams. Her Borneo tribemate Richard Hatch (a member of Mogo Mogo) rubbed up against her while naked during the challenge, leaving her totally distraught, despite her tribe winning the challenge. In the subsequent episode, Susan seemed to become more and more angered, embarrassed, and upset over the incident. At the next Reward Challenge, Survivor host Jeff Probst made a passing reference to the incident, which prompted Susan to respond with a furious speech, accusing Probst of making light of something that Susan viewed as harassment. Due to the nature of the show, Susan's competitors were unsure how much of her emotion was real and how much was part of the game. Despite the fact that Richard had been eliminated in the prior episode, Susan claimed that "her mind left the game 24 hours ago" and decided to remove herself from the stress of the game in order to be with her husband again.	6	0	13	6	5	1.17	17	0.35
7	Colby Donaldson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Colby_Donaldson	3	Colby was chosen to participate in Survivor: All-Stars, where he was on the Mogo Mogo tribe. Right away, Colby told his tribe that he didn't trust anybody. The tribe came in second in the first two Immunity Challenges, but they faced a setback when Jenna Morasca quit the game after the first two Tribal Councils.\n\nAfter a shocking tribe absorption, the tribe gained former Saboga members Ethan Zohn and Jerri Manthey. Colby liked the idea of having a former winner on his tribe to target, and he also liked being reunited with his former Australia tribemate in Jerri. The tribe lost the next Immunity Challenge, and they unanimously agreed to vote out Richard Hatch, who Colby didn't wish to work with due to his reputation and lack of trust. His comments at that Tribal Council regarding certain players coasting, and a follow up conversation with Shii Ann Huang, strained his relationship with her.\n\nThe tribe ultimately lost the next Immunity Challenge, and it was clear it was either Colby, Ethan, or Jerri going home next. Colby made a deal with Ethan that Jerri had to go next, and the two cast their votes for her, while the rest of the tribe considered Colby as a strong, physical threat in the possibility of a merge. Furthermore, Jerri was motivated by revenge as Colby had voted her out in their original season. Lex ended up siding with Jerri and Shii Ann as Colby was voted out in a 3-2 vote and finished in twelfth place.\n\nAt the Survivor: America's Tribal Council special, Colby was in the final four for Fan Favorite Player of the season but ultimately lost to Rupert Boneham. He did, however, win the award for "Sexiest Male" of the first 8 seasons.	6	0	12	4	5	3	19	0.32
4	Rob Cesternino	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Rob_Cesternino	2	Rob was a member of the Chapera tribe. Due to Chapera's streak of Immunity Challenge wins, he did not have to worry about voting anyone out for the first week of the game. However, Rob found a rival in fellow Chapera tribemate Rob Mariano, who was the de facto leader that was calling the shots. Rob C. attempted to show that he could contribute to his tribe by hunting down the final key to their rice box, but coincidentally, his rival had found the final key first.\n\nAt the Immunity Challenge, Rob C. and Amber Brkich sat out, and Rob C. could only watch helplessly as his tribe was pummeled by the large puzzle pieces carried by the other blindfolded tribe members. Mogo Mogo managed to edge out the dominant Chapera at the last second to send Chapera to their first Tribal Council.\n\nRob M. attempted to make a fake alliance with Rob C. to ease his fears over going home. However, Rob C. was skeptical of him. At Tribal Council, Rob C.'s smart and savvy gameplay marked him as a threat by Amber and Rob M., and he was unanimously voted out.	4	0	15	7	8	3	12	0.33
5	Richard Hatch	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Hatch	2	Richard's appearance on Survivor: All-Stars was a short, but eventful one. He, according to host Jeff Probst, "smuggled a canister of matches up his bum", earning his Mogo Mogo tribe fire. In every Immunity Challenge, he competed naked. On Day 7, while he went fishing, he got bitten by a shark which his tribe would eat. However, Mogo Mogo lost one member on Day 9 when The Amazon winner Jenna Morasca quit in order to be with her dying mother.\n\nWhen the Saboga tribe was dissolved on Day 13, Mogo Mogo gained two extra members, Ethan Zohn and Jerri Manthey, and when they lost immunity on Day 15, the tribe immediately targeted Richard. Although Richard got wind of his impending doom and put together a counter strategy by aligning with the girls of his tribe, Jerri, Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien, and Shii Ann Huang, for a majority alliance to vote out the guys, starting with Colby Donaldson, his plans were foiled and he was voted out unanimously. Afterward, he screamed, "I've been bamboozled!", much to the amusement of his tribemates and Jeff Probst. It is worthy to note that in the challenge, he "accidentally" bumped into fellow Borneo contestant Susan Hawk while he was naked. This caused her to quit in the next episode.	5	0	14	7	6	4	15	0.33
1	Tina Wesson	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Tina_Wesson	3	Tina returned for Survivor: All-Stars and was initially placed on the Saboga tribe. The tribe was immediately divided between three pairs: Jenna Lewis and Tina's former The Australian Outback tribemate Jerri Manthey over their resentment of having previous winners, as well as Tina and Jerri's past history, Tina and Africa winner Ethan Zohn, who aligned out of necessity as former winners, and Rudy Boesch and Rupert Boneham, who found themselves in the middle of the other two pairs.\n\nAfter Saboga lost the first Immunity Challenge, Jenna L. and Jerri targeted Tina over Ethan, feeling that Ethan's physical abilities would be more valuable in challenges. In response, Tina and Ethan targeted Jenna L., who was leading the charge against the former winners. Though both sides attempted to secure Rudy and Rupert as the critical swing votes, at Tribal Council, Rudy and Rupert decided to align with Jenna L. and Jerri, sending Tina home in a 4-2 vote.	0	0	18	7	6	2	3	0.00
9	Jerri Manthey	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jerri_Manthey	3	Jerri's iconic showing in The Australian Outback earned her a spot in Survivor: All-Stars, where she was placed on the Saboga tribe.\n\nDespite her resolve to not be overly-opinionated, she and Rupert Boneham argued over conflicting plans for a Reward Challenge, where were requested to create the best tribe shelter. After the argument, the tribe decided to follow Rupert's plan, digging an underground log cabin. Not only did they lose the challenge, but they found their shelter ineffective during a storm, with the log cabin completely filled with water, leaving Saboga unprotected from the harsh weather, making Jerri very emotional. Despite her tribe's misfortunes, Jerri rallied Saboga to win their first Immunity Challenge on Day 11. The victory was short-lived, when Saboga lost the following special challenge, where Saboga would be dissolved, while its remaining members were distributed to the other two tribes. Jerri, along with Ethan Zohn, went to Mogo Mogo, where she was reunited with Colby Donaldson.\n\nAfter helping the tribe voting out Richard Hatch, Jerri decided to seek revenge for Colby's perceived mistreatment of her back in The Australian Outback. With Colby gone, Jerri helped the tribe eliminate his closest ally Ethan (the last former winner and Jerri's tribemate from Saboga), making him the next to go.\n\nOn Day 22, the tribes anticipated a merge, only to reveal a tribe switch. Remarkably, the random shuffle resulted in every member of Mogo Mogo trading places with a member of Chapera, leaving Amber Brkich as the only remaining Chapera member on a tribe with Jerri, Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien, Lex van den Berghe, and Shii Ann Huang. Jerri was delighted to be with her "Outback Sister".\n\nAfter Chapera lost the next Immunity Challenge, Amber's closest ally Rob Mariano felt distraught at the prospect of Amber being sent home - and immediately made a hasty protection deal with Lex after the challenge. Lex was forced to weigh his options: either throwing a wrench in Rob and the former Chapera members' plans in the event of a merge, or cutting loose his loyal ally Jerri. Eventually, with Kathy's help, Lex decided to boot Jerri, who was voted out unanimously.	4	0	10	7	6	3.56	24	0.17
3	Jenna Morasca	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Jenna_Morasca	2	Jenna M. returned to Survivor and was assigned to the Mogo Mogo tribe. Jenna originally had plans to start an all-women alliance with fellow tribemates Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien and Shii Ann Huang, but things were quickly broken up when the first Survivor winner, Richard Hatch, overheard them scheming on the first day and reported it back to the two other tribe members of Mogo Mogo, Colby Donaldson and Lex van den Berghe. Mogo Mogo did not have to worry though, as the tribe won the first two Immunity Challenges.\n\nHowever, from Days 6 to 8, Jenna revealed that she was not as focused on the game, stating that she "felt a vibe" that her mother's health was worsening. Kathy, noticing that Jenna M. was not eating, comforted her and told her that she would not hate Jenna M. if she stepped away from the game. When the tribes convened at the supposed Immunity Challenge on Day 9, Jenna M. stated that she would depart the game, feeling that she had to be with her mother. After Jenna M. announced she was withdrawing from the game, Jeff Probst called in a boat for her, cancelled the Immunity Challenge, and she received hugs from all remaining players in the game. While walking to the boat, Probst told her that he and the other fifteen castaways were thinking of her. Sadly, her mother passed away from cancer eight days after Jenna M. returned home.	3	0	16	9	4	1.67	9	0.33

15	Eliza Orlins	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Eliza_Orlins	2	Upon arriving on the beach, Eliza noticed quickly that the men and the women were being separated. She also realized that the men were the ones in the center of the action, despite supposedly everyone being a part of the opening ceremony. Once it was over, the tribes were divided by gender. Eliza's tribe was called Yasur. On the way to the camp, some of the members wanted to wait until morning to find the camp. Eliza along with Twila Tanner disagreed. Eventually, the women reached the camp that night. Eliza quickly befriended the other younger girls (Julie Berry, Dolly Neely, and Mia Galeotalanza). Twila and Scout Cloud Lee were annoyed by the girls' constant talking, with Eliza being deemed the most annoying. At the first Immunity Challenge, the women were able to win the challenge because of Chris Daugherty's inability to cross the balance beam. The women were also able to win the next Reward Challenge and blankets. At this point, the tribe was divided by youth and work ethic. The young women were joined by Lisa Keiffer. The women lost the Immunity Challenge and Eliza was in danger due to her constant talking. Dolly shifted the vote to Leann Slaby because of her flying under the radar. However, when she talked to Dolly, Eliza was left with the impression Dolly was going to flip and vote out Eliza. Although Dolly stayed loyal to the young girls, Eliza helped blindside her.\n\nEliza immediately rejoined her original alliance, but they were still wary of her. At the next challenge, it was revealed that both tribes would go to Tribal Council. Yasur lost the reward part of the challenge had to watch the Lopevi men compete for immunity. In a twist, The winner, John Kenney, stayed with the women until just before the vote to give one of them immunity. John separated the girls by who voted out Dolly to expose alliances. Eliza immediately explained her side of the story, unknowingly annoying him as well. Mia wanted Twila out due to a recent argument with her. Eliza suggested voting Scout out for being a detriment in challenges, but Mia didn't relent. At Tribal Council, John gave immunity to Ami Cusack and Mia was blindsided in a 5-3 vote. Lisa flipped to the older women's alliance because she didn't trust Eliza. The women won the next two challenges, with Eliza being the one responsible for the immunity win.\n\nOn Day 11, local tribesman came to the two camps and asked for a tribe chief. The women elected Scout due to being the wisest and the eldest. Later, it was the that the tribes were switching. Scout placed Eliza with Bubba Sampson, Leann, Rory Freeman, and Ami. Sarge Masters deemed the other group Lopevi. After being unpicked, Lisa willingly went to Yasur. Yasur went on a losing streak. Bubba was the first to go due to telling Chris to "remember the merge" in earshot of Ami while at the Immunity Challenge. At the second Reward Challenge after the switch, Eliza was a hindrance and Yasur lost again. Rory felt that Eliza's poor performance would give him the ability to crack Ami's alliance. Eliza was unable to perform at the Immunity Challenge due to Leann's struggle in the underwater obstacle course. However, It would be Lisa who became the target because she asked Ami how to gather food "just in case". Yasur was able to make a comeback to win the next two challenges, winning a trip to a coffee house and immunity. The next challenge, Lopevi won milk, cookies, and chocolate cake.\n\nThe next day, the tribes merged. At the first individual Immunity Challenge, Eliza narrowly beat Chris for a spot in the final round but lost the challenge to Sarge. Everyone moved to the Lopevi camp and was ecstatic to have a feast await them. Under Ami's influence, Twila and Julie flipped to the women and blindsided Rory in a 6-4 vote. At the next challenge, Eliza was the first woman out. She was angered by being on the bottom. When Leann and Julie returned from the reward, they shared the chicken wings with the women, leaving the men only the tips. At the Immunity Challenge, Eliza was the first woman out again. Ami won immunity and made sure the women stayed strong. Sarge was voted out, with his vote going to Eliza.\n\nAt this point, Scout was fed up with Eliza and plotted with the men to oust her. At the Reward Challenge, Eliza's team won the challenge. They went to a local village and indulged in the culture and food. When they returned, Eliza noticed something was up due to Julie's behavior. At the Immunity Challenge, Twila defeated Chad Crittenden for the win. At Tribal Council, Eliza was questioned by Jeff for bringing her bag at every Tribal Council. He referred to her as the girl who cried wolf. She countered by the fact that she was considered to be voted out every time and it was valid 100%. When the vote came, the women held strong and Eliza was spared while Chad was voted out.\n\nThe next challenge was the Loved Ones Challenge, with the winner getting an online chat with their loved one. Eliza beat out Julie to spend time with mother, Susan. However, her mother and the other loved ones were on location and Eliza got to spend a whole day with her mom. Eliza explained that she was nearly voted out for talking too much. Once she had to leave, Susan gave her daughter the shirt off her back because she needed one. Eliza was worried the visit would make the others jealous. The loved ones returned for the Immunity Challenge. Ami won the challenge with her girlfriend, Chrissy. After the challenge, Chris told her that Julie claimed that Eliza was the one going home. Chris pleaded with Eliza to vote with him, Twila, and Scout to eliminate Leann. Eliza had her reservations but she agreed. Chris was right as she received the other votes; however, Leann was blindsided.\n\nEliza and Ami were angered at Twila and Scout for their betrayal. At the Reward Challenge, the castaways competed for a Pontiac G6 and a trip to a spa. Eliza was able to beat out Ami for the car and the girls were joined by Chris at the spa. Both Ami and Chris talked strategy with Eliza. Chris later defeated Ami for individual immunity. Eliza considered flipping to Ami and Julie to vote out Scout. At Tribal Council, Eliza agreed that Twila's swearing on her son's name was immoral but still voted out Ami.\n\nJulie and Eliza started to realign themselves and hoped that Chris would join them. Julie won the Reward Challenge and took Chris with her. While trapped with Twila and Scout, they annoyed her to no end. Eliza declared she was done with both of them. When Chris returned, they talked. During the conversation, Chris promised that they were going to the final three. Eliza simply corrected him by saying the Final Two, which he hastily agreed. Eliza won the Immunity Challenge. Afterwards, Chris was weighing his options between siding with Julie or Twila. Twila caught Eliza talking about voting her out, leading to a major argument. At Tribal Council, Eliza was shocked when Julie was blindsided. After Tribal Council, Twila and Eliza accused each other of being undeserving of coming this far. Eliza talked to Chris and he claimed that his vote was the alliance. Eliza was amazed by who was in the final four. Eliza prayed that she would win immunity, however, Chris was victorious. Eliza was happy as she thought Chris and herself were going to Day 39. Unfortunately for Eliza, Chris deemed Eliza too much of a threat to win the Final Immunity Challenge and the jury vote. Eliza was voted out on Day 37. As her torch was snuffed, Eliza glared at Chris, who nonchalantly waved goodbye.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Eliza embarked on a long rant deriding the finalists for their deceptive conduct. Afterwards, Eliza demanded an apology from both finalists. Twila refused to entertain her request, while Chris complied. Because he apologized and she liked him better, Eliza voted for Chris to win.	10	0	4	7	6	3.86	37	0.27
13	Ami Cusack	https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Ami_Cusack	2	During the welcoming ceremony, Ami was annoyed that she was put second to a man. The tribal chief divided the tribes by gender and Ami was placed on the Yasur tribe. The women won the first challenge because of Chris Daugherty's inability to stay on the balance beam. The women also won the Reward Challenge and comfort items, once again due to the men's inability to cross a balance beam. However at camp, the women were divided between youth and work ethic. Ami preferred the hard workers and bonded well with Leann Slaby. They failed to work together in the Immunity Challenge and lost badly. After the challenge, a paranoid Eliza Orlins came to Ami with a proposition to vote out swing vote Dolly Neely. The plan worked and Dolly was blindsided. At the next challenge, it was revealed to be a double Tribal Council. Yasur lost the reward part of the challenge. As a stipulation of winning the individual immunity, John Kenney spent time at the Yasur camp to decide on who gets the individual immunity for Yasur. Hoping not to disrupt the intended elimination, John decided to give it to Ami. Ami's alliance proceeded to vote off the temperamental Mia Galeotalanza. The Yasur tribe won the next two challenges, winning a native wilderness guide, named Da, to show them the resources of their camp, and immunity.\n\nOn Day 11, native Vanuatu tribesman came to the Yasur, wanting the women to pick a tribe leader. The women agreed the oldest member, Scout Cloud Lee. A tribe switch occurred with Scout and Lea "Sarge" Masters in charge of mixing tribes. Scout picked the tribes that Ami would stay with Eliza, and Leann and introduced to Travis "Bubba" Sampson and Rory Freeman. Sarge picked the other group as the Lopevi tribe. The new Yasur also gotten Lisa Keiffer when she chose Yasur over Lopevi. Yasur lost the first challenge of the new tribes. At the Immunity Challenge, Ami hears Bubba asking Chris to throw the challenge. Angered by this, Ami successfully campaigned for Bubba's elimination. Yasur lost the next two challenges. Although Rory was the initial target, Ami deemed Lisa untrustworthy and arranged for elimination as well. Yasur won the next challenge, winning a coffee shop and loved-one letters and pictures. Although she bonded with everyone, Ami was dead-set on voting out Rory, much to the latter's anger. This would be averted as Rory won the women immunity. Despite that, Ami still targeted Rory.\n\nAfter losing cookies and milk in a Reward Challenge, the tribes merged at the next Immunity Challenge. Ami agreed with Twila Tanner's recommendation of staying at the Lopevi camp. In the first individual Immunity Challenge, Ami made to it the final round but lost to Sarge. At camp, Ami was targeted by the Lopevi men because Rory informed them of what was going down at Yasur. Ami was safe because Twila and Julie Berry deemed it was their best interest to go with the women over the men. Ami's alliance eliminated Sarge and Chad quickly. Ami wanted Chris to go next as he failed to win immunity (which she won). Her closest ally, Leann, didn't feel right about sending Chris to the jury as they sent Lisa home. Ami was willing to accommodate for Leann and vote out Eliza. Unfortunately, Chris used this opportunity to form a counter-alliance with Eliza, Twila, and Scout to blindside Leann. In the minority, Ami tried to get Eliza to turn against the duo of Twila and Scout. Ami failed in both winning immunity and swaying Eliza to her side. Ami was voted out in a 4-2 vote and became the fourth member of the jury.\n\nAt Final Tribal Council, Ami pointed out the irony that Twila would do anything for the million dollars but refused to apologize to Eliza. Ami then asked Chris what genuine qualities he had to beat her. Chris said he possessed none and that the two people with the least amount of those genuine qualities were the finalists. Twila, who was asked the same question, said that she herself was cold, and that Ami didn't have it in her to be cold. Ami gave her vote to Twila for giving answers from her heart.	10	0	6	8	7	3.17	33	0.30
